@DP ~ ~ ~ ~I @DropCapTwo {{@S {n {@OuterNote { 10.5p @Font {@B 1}}} the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth,}} 
 }
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {2}}} while the earth was still unformed and chaotic,
 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~with darkness on the surface of the deep, 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~and the spirit of God brooding over the waters, 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~God {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {3}}} said, {@Char quotedblleft}Let there be light,{@Char quotedblright} and there was light,
 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {4}}} God saw that the light was good.
 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~Then he separated the light from the darkness. 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {5}}} he called the light Day and the darkness Night.
 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~And there was an evening and a morning, making the
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  first day. 

@DP ~

@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {6}}} God said, {@Char quotedblleft}Let there be a dome between the waters,
 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~and let it separate the waters from the waters.{@Char quotedblright}
 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {7}}} God made the dome to separate the waters below
 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~from the waters which were above it. 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~And it was done. 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {8}}} God called the dome the Sky.
 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~And there was an evening and a morning, making the
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  second day. 

@DP ~

@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {9}}} God said, {@Char quotedblleft}Let the waters under the sky be gathered
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  together, 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~and let the dry land appear.{@Char quotedblright} 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~And it was done. 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {10}}} God called the dry land Earth
 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~and he called the gathered waters Seas. 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~And God saw that it was good. 

@DP ~

@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {11}}} God said, {@Char quotedblleft}Let the earth put forth vegetation:
 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~Plants on the earth which yield their own kind of seed,
 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~and trees that bear fruits in which are their own seed.{@Char quotedblright}
 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~And it was done. 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {12}}} the earth brought forth vegetation:
 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~Seed-bearing plants,, 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~and trees with seed-bearing fruit. 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~And God saw that it was good. 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {13}}} there was an evening and a morning, making the
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  third day. 

@DP ~

@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {14}}} God said, {@Char quotedblleft}Let there be lights in the dome of the sky
 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~to separate the night from the day. 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~Let them be signs to mark the seasons, the days, and
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  the years. 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~Let {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {15}}} them be lights in the dome of the sky to light
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  the earth.{@Char quotedblright}
 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~And it was done. 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {16}}} God made the two great lights:
 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~The greater to rule the day and the lesser to rule
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  the night. 

@DP ~

@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~God made the stars also and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {17}}} placed them in the dome of the sky
 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~to shed light upon the earth, 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~to {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {18}}} rule over the day and over the night,
 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~and to separate light from darkness. 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~And God saw that it was good. 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {19}}} there was an evening and a morning, making the
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  fourth day. 

@DP ~

@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {20}}} God said, {@Char quotedblleft}Let the waters teem with living creatures,
 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~and let birds fly over the earth in the open dome of
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  the sky.{@Char quotedblright}
 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {21}}} God created the great sea monsters,
 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~all kinds of living, moving creatures with which the
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  waters teem, 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~and all kinds of winged birds. 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~And God saw that it was good. 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {22}}} he blessed them, saying, {@Char quotedblleft}Be fruitful,
 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~increase, and fill the waters in the seas, 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~and let the birds multiply on the earth.{@Char quotedblright}
 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {23}}} there was an evening and a morning, making the
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  fifth day. 

@DP ~

@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {24}}} God said, {@Char quotedblleft}Let the earth bring forth all kinds
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  of living creatures: 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~Cattle and reptiles and wild beasts.{@Char quotedblright}
 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~And it was done. 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {25}}} God made all the different kinds of wild beasts,
 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~and the cattle, and everything that crawls upon the ground.
 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~And God saw that it was good. 

@DP ~

@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {26}}} God said, {@Char quotedblleft}Let us make humans in our image,
 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~and let them rule over the fish of the sea, 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~the birds of the heavens, the cattle, the wild beasts,
 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~and all the reptiles that crawl upon the ground.{@Char quotedblright}
 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {27}}} God created humans like himself, like God he created
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  them. 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~He created them male and female. 

@DP ~

@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {28}}} God blessed them, and said to them:
 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~{@Char quotedblleft}Be fruitful, grow in number, 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~fill the earth and govern it; 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~rule over the fish of the sea, the birds of the heavens,
 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~and over every living thing that crawls on the ground,{@Char quotedblright}
 

@DP ~

@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {29}}} God said, {@Char quotedblleft}See, to you I give every seed-bearing plant
 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~on the face of all the earth, 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~and every tree that has seed-bearing fruit.{@Char quotedbl}
 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~It will be food for you, 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {30}}} to every wild beast and to every bird of the heavens,
 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~and to everything that crawls on the earth, in which
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  there is life, 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~I give every green plant for food.{@Char quotedblright}
 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~And it was done. 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {31}}} when God saw all that he had made,
 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~he perceived that it was very good. 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~And there was an evening and a morning, making the
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  sixth day. 

@DP ~

@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~So {@OuterNote { 10.5p @Font {@B 2}}} the heavens and the earth were finished, and everything
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  in them. 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {2}}} on the seventh day God finished the work which
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  he had done, 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~he rested on the seventh day from all his work; 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {3}}} God blessed the seventh day and set it apart,
 
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~for in it he rested from all the creative work which
@LLP ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  he had done. 

@DP ~
This {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {4}}} is the story of the heavens and earth when they were created.

@Section @Title {The garden} @Begin @LP


@LP
At the time when the  {@S {Lord }} God made earth and heaven, there {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {5}}} were not yet any plants on the earth, and no vegetation had sprung up; for the 
 {@S {Lord }} God had not sent rain upon the earthearth, and there was no one to till the soil.
 A {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {6}}} mist used to rise from the earth and water all the surface of the ground.
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {7}}} the  {@S {Lord }} God moulded man out of dust taken from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living being.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {8}}} the  {@S {Lord }} God planted a garden in Eden, far in the East; and placed the man he had formed there.
 From {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {9}}} the soil the  {@S {Lord }} God made grow all kinds of trees that are pleasant to look at and good for food, with the tree of life also in the middle of the garden and the tree that gives the knowledge of good and evil.
 

@PP
A {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {10}}} river flowed out of Eden and watered the garden; and from there branched into four.
 The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {11}}} name of the first is Pishon; which flows round the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.
 The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {12}}} gold of that land is pure; and there is aromatic gum and the onyx stone.
 The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {13}}} name of the second river is Gihon; which flows around the whole land of Cush,
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {14}}} the name of the third river is the Tigris; which heads toward the east of Asshur. The fourth river is the Euphrates.
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {15}}} the  {@S {Lord }} God took the man and placed him in the garden of Eden to till it and to care for it.
 The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {16}}}  {@S {Lord }} God also gave the man this command: {@Char quotedblleft}You may freely eat from every tree of the garden,
 except {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {17}}} from the tree that gives the knowledge of good and evil; from this you must not eat, for on the day that you eat from it you will surely die.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {18}}} the  {@S {Lord }} God said, {@Char quotedblleft}It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make a helper suited to him.{@Char quotedblright}
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {19}}} out of the ground the  {@S {Lord }} God formed all the wild beasts and birds, and made them come to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever he called each living creature, that was its name.
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {20}}} the man gave names to all cattle and all the wild birds and beasts; but for the man himself there was found no helper suited to him.
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {21}}} the  {@S {Lord }} God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep, and while he slept, he took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh.
 With {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {22}}} the rib which he had taken from the man, the 
 {@S {Lord }} built up  a woman and brought her to the man. Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {23}}} the man said, {@Char quotedblleft}This now is bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh. She will be called Woman, for from man she was taken.{@Char quotedblright}
 For {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {24}}} this reason a man leaves his father and his mother and clings to his wife, and the two become one.
 

@PP
The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {25}}} man and his wife were both naked, yet felt no shame.
 

@PP
Now {@OuterNote { 10.5p @Font {@B 3}}} the serpent was craftier than any other wild beast that the 
 {@S {Lord }} God had made, and it said to the woman, {@Char quotedblleft}Has God really commanded, {@Char quoteleft}You must not eat from any tree of the garden{@Char quoteright}?{@Char quotedblright}
 The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {2}}} woman answered, {@Char quotedblleft}We are allowed to eat the fruit of all the trees of the garden;
 only {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {3}}} regarding the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God has said, {@Char quoteleft}You must not eat from it, nor should you touch it, for if you do, you will die.{@Char quoteright}{@Char quotedblright}
 Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {4}}} the serpent said to the woman, {@Char quotedblleft}You will not surely die;
 for {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {5}}} God knows that on the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like gods, knowing what is good and what is evil.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {6}}} the woman saw that the tree was good for food and attractive to look at and desirable for acquiring wisdom, she took some of its fruit and ate. Then she gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate.
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {7}}} the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; so they sewed fig-leaves together to cover themselves.
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {8}}} when they heard the sound of the footsteps of the 
 {@S {Lord }} God, as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, the man and his wife hid from him among the trees of the garden.
 

@PP
When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {9}}} the  {@S {Lord }} God called to the man and said to him, {@Char quotedblleft}Where are you?{@Char quotedblright}
 He {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {10}}} replied, {@Char quotedblleft}I heard the sound of your footsteps in the garden and I was afraid, because I was naked; so I hid myself.{@Char quotedblright}
 The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {11}}}  {@S {Lord }} God said, {@Char quotedblleft}Who told you that you were naked? Did you eat from the tree from which I forbade you to eat?{@Char quotedblright}
 The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {12}}} man answered, {@Char quotedblleft}The woman who you  placed beside me, she gave me fruit from the tree and I ate.{@Char quotedblright}
 The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {13}}}  {@S {Lord }} God said to the woman, {@Char quotedblleft}What is this that you have done?{@Char quotedblright} The woman replied, {@Char quotedblleft}The serpent deceived me, and I ate.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {14}}} the  {@S {Lord }} God said to the serpent, {@Char quotedblleft}Because you have done this, you will be more accursed than all cattle and all the wild beasts. You will crawl on your belly and eat dust all your life.
 I {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {15}}} will establish enmity between you and the woman and between your descendants and her descendants. They will bruise your head, and you will wound them on the heel.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
To {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {16}}} the woman he said, {@Char quotedblleft}I will greatly increase your anguish and pain during your pregnancy; with pain will you bear children. You will desire  your husband, but he will rule over you.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
To {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {17}}} the man he said, {@Char quotedblleft}Because you have listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten of the tree from which I forbade you to eat, the ground will be cursed because of you; as long as you live, you will earn a living only by painful toil.
 The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {18}}} ground will always bring forth thorns and thistles, and you will eat the plants of the field.
 By {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {19}}} the sweat of your brow you will eat bread, until you return to the ground, for from it you were taken; for dust you are, and to dust you shall return!{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {20}}} man, Adam, named his wife Eve; because she was the mother of all living beings,
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {21}}} the  {@S {Lord }} God made garments of skins for Adam and his wife to clothe them.
 

@PP
But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {22}}} the  {@S {Lord }} God said: {@Char quotedblleft}The man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not reach out his hand, and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever.{@Char quotedblright}
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {23}}} the  {@S {Lord }} God sent him out of the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he had been taken.
 He {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {24}}} drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden the cherubim, and the flaming sword which turned every way, to bar the way to the tree of life.

@LP
{@S {Adam {@OuterNote { 10.5p @Font {@B 4}}} lay with his wife Eve and she gave birth to Cain,}}  and she said, {@Char quotedblleft}I have created a man with the help of the 
 {@S {Lord }} !{@Char quotedblright} She {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {2}}} also gave birth to his brother Abel. Abel was a shepherd, but Cain was a farmer.
 

@PP
In {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {3}}} the course of time Cain brought some of the produce of the ground as an offering to the 
 {@S {Lord }} . Abel {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {4}}} too brought some of the choicest animals of his flock and sacrificed their fat pieces. And the 
 {@S {Lord }} looked with approval on Abel and his offering; but {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {5}}} he could not receive Cain and his offering with approval.
 

@PP
Therefore Cain was very angry and his face fell. So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {6}}} the 
 {@S {Lord }} said to Cain, {@Char quotedblleft}Why are you angry and why do you scowl?
 If {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {7}}} you do what is right and good, will not your offering be accepted? But if you do wrong, sin crouches at the door and the inclination to sin will overcome you, but you should master it.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
Cain {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {8}}} said to his brother Abel, {@Char quotedblleft}Let us go into the field.{@Char quotedblright} And while they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother and killed him.
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {9}}} the  {@S {Lord }} said to Cain, {@Char quotedblleft}Where is your brother Abel?{@Char quotedblright} He answered, {@Char quotedblleft}I do not know; am I my brother's keeper?{@Char quotedblright}
 The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {10}}}  {@S {Lord }} said, {@Char quotedblleft}What have you done? Listen! Your brother's blood is crying to me from the ground.
 Even {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {11}}} now you are cursed by the very ground that has opened to receive your brother's blood from your hand.
 Whenever {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {12}}} you till the ground, it will no longer yield to you its strength; you will be a vagabond and a wanderer on the earth.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {13}}} Cain said to the  {@S {Lord }}, {@Char quotedblleft}My punishment is more than I can bear.
  {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {14}}} See, you have driven me out today from this land, and I will no longer be able to worship you; I shall become a vagabond and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {15}}} the  {@S {Lord }} said to him, {@Char quotedblleft}If any one kills you, the crime shall be avenged sevenfold.{@Char quotedblright} So the 
 {@S {Lord }} placed a tribal mark on Cain, to keep any one who found him from killing him.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {16}}} Cain departed from the  {@S {Lord }}

When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {5}}} the  {@S {Lord }} saw that people's wickedness  was increasing in the world, and that the trend of their thoughts was at all times toward evil,
 he {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {6}}} was greatly grieved and regretted that he had made people on the earth.
 Therefore {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {7}}} the  {@S {Lord }} said, {@Char quotedblleft}I will destroy all living beings from off the ground -- people, animals, creeping things, and birds -- because I regret that I have made them.{@Char quotedblright}
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {8}}} Noah had won the  {@S {Lord }}'s favor.
 

@PP
 {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {9}}} This is the story of Noah. Among the people of his time, Noah was righteous and wholehearted; Noah walked with God.
 Noah {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {10}}} had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
 God {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {11}}} saw that the earth was corrupt and full of violence.
 God {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {12}}} looked at the earth and saw that it was corrupt; all living things on the earth had become corrupt in their ways.
 

@PP
So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {13}}} God said to Noah, {@Char quotedblleft}I have determined to put an end to all living beings, for the earth is filled with their acts of injustice; I am going to destroy them from the earth.
 Make {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {14}}} yourself an ark of cypress wood. Construct rooms in the ark, and coat it within and without with pitch.
 This {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {15}}} is how you shall build it: the length of the ark shall be five hundred feet, its breadth eighty feet, and its height fifty feet.
 Make {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {16}}} a roof for it and place the door on the side. Construct it with lower, second, and third storeys.
 For {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {17}}} I am about to bring floods of water upon the earth to destroy from under heaven every living thing in which is the breath of life; every thing that is on the earth shall die.
 

@PP
{@Char quotedblleft}But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {18}}} I will make a solemn agreement with you. Go into the ark with your sons, your wife and their wives,
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {19}}} take with you into the ark two of every kind living thing, a male and a female,
 birds, {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {20}}} animals and creeping things, so that they might be kept alive.
 Take {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {21}}} and store food for them and you.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
Noah {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {22}}} did all this. He did everything that God told him to.
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 10.5p @Font {@B 7}}} the  {@S {Lord }} said to Noah, {@Char quotedblleft}Enter with all your household into the ark; for I see that in this age you are living before me an upright life.
 Take {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {2}}} seven of all the beasts that are fit for food and sacrifice, the male and the female; but of the beasts that are not fit for food and sacrifice take only two, the male and the female;
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {3}}} of the wild birds that are fit for food and sacrifice take seven, to keep the species alive on the  earth.
 After {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {4}}} seven days I will send rain on the earth forty days and forty nights; and I will destroy from the surface of the ground every living thing that I have made.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {5}}} Noah did all that the  {@S {Lord }} commanded him.
 He {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {6}}} was six hundred years old, and when the waters of the flood came upon the earth
 he, {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {7}}} his sons, his wife, and his sons' wives, entered the ark because of the waters of the flood
 together {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {8}}} with the beasts that were fit for food and sacrifice and the beasts that were not fit, and the birds, and everything that creeps upon the ground.
 Two {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {9}}} by two, male and female, they entered the ark as God had commanded Noah.
 

@PP
And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {10}}} after seven days, the flood waters came.
 In {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {11}}} the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that very day, all the fountains of the great deep burst open, and the windows of heaven were opened -- and
 it {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {12}}} rained for forty days and forty nights.
 That {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {13}}} was the day that Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, went into the ark, and
 every {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {14}}} type of animal, and cattle, and creeping thing that creeps on the earth, and bird
 went {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {15}}} with Noah into the ark, two by two of every kind of living thing.
 They {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {16}}} went in, male and female, as God had commanded Noah; and the 
 {@S {Lord }} shut Noah in the ark. 

@PP
The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {17}}} flood continued for forty days, and the waters increased and raised up the ark, and it was lifted high above the earth.
 It {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {18}}} floated on the surface as the waters rose higher over the land.
 Higher {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {19}}} the waters rose over the land -- until the highest mountains were covered
 by {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {20}}} more than twenty feet. 

@PP
All {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {21}}} creatures on the land, bird and cattle and animals, every creature that swarms on the ground, every person,
 everything {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {22}}} on dry land in whose nostrils was the breath of life, died.
 The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {23}}}  {@S {Lord }} destroyed everything that existed upon the face of the ground, both man and cattle, and creeping things, and the birds of the heavens, and Noah only was left and they who were with him in the ark.
 

@PP
The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {24}}} waters did not start to go down for a hundred and fifty days.
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 10.5p @Font {@B 8}}} God remembered Noah and all the beasts and all the animals that were with him in the ark; and God caused a wind to blow over the earth, and the flood subsided,
 the {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {2}}} fountains of the deed were stopped and the windows of heaven closed, and the rain from heaven ceased,
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {3}}} the waters withdrew more and more from the land for a hundred and fifty days.
 On {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {4}}} the seventeenth day of the seventh month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.
 The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {5}}} waters continued to go down until, on the first day of the tenth month, the tops of the mountains could be seen.
 

@PP
After {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {6}}} forty days Noah opened the window of the ark,
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {7}}} sent out a raven; and it kept going to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth.
 He {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {8}}} also sent out a dove to see if the waters had subsided from the surface of the ground;
 but {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {9}}} the dove found no rest for her foot, and so returned to him to the ark, for the waters covered the surface of the whole earth. So he reached out his hand and took her and brought her back into the ark.
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {10}}} he waited seven days longer and again sent out the dove from the ark.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {11}}} the dove came in to him at dusk; and in her mouth was a freshly plucked olive-leaf. So Noah knew that the waters had subsided from the earth.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {12}}} he waited seven days more and sent out the dove; but it did not return to him again.
 

@PP
So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {13}}} it was that in the first day of the first month of Noah's six hundred and first year, the waters had dried up. Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked, and saw that the surface of the ground was dry.
 It {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {14}}} was the twenty-seventh day of the second month.
 

@PP
God {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {15}}} said to Noah, {@Char quotedblleft}Leave {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {16}}} the ark with your wife and sons and their wives.
 Bring {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {17}}} out every living creature, every bird, cattle, and creeping thing that creeps on the earth, so that they can spread over the earth, and be fruitful and multiply.{@Char quotedblright}
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {18}}} Noah left the ark with his sons and his wife and his son's wives,
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {19}}} every living creature, every creeping thing, every bird came out one kind after another.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {20}}} Noah built an altar to the  {@S {Lord
 }} and took one of every beast and bird that was fit for sacrifice and offered burnt-offerings on the altar.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {21}}} when the  {@S {Lord }} smelled the pleasing odour, he said to himself, {@Char quotedblleft}I will never again curse the ground because of people  because the inclination of their heart is evil from their youth, nor will I again destroy every living thing, as I have done.
 While {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {22}}} the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, shall not cease.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 10.5p @Font {@B 9}}} God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, {@Char quotedblleft}Bear children and multiply and repopulate the earth.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {2}}} every wild beast and bird and everything that creeps on the ground and all the fish of the sea shall fear and dread you; into your hand they are given.
 Every {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {3}}} moving thing that lives shall be food for you; as I gave the green herbs, I give them all to you.
 Only {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {4}}} you shall not eat flesh while the life is in it, that is, the blood.
 

@PP
{@Char quotedblleft}Moreover, {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {5}}} your own life-blood will I require for a person's life; from every beast will I require it, and from everyone who takes another's life.
 Whoever {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {6}}} sheds a person's  blood, by people shall their blood be shed; for God made people in his own image.
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {7}}} you are to bear children and repopulate the whole earth and subdue it.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
God {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {8}}} also said to Noah and to his sons with him,
 {@Char quotedblleft}Now {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {9}}} I make this solemn agreement with you and with your descendants
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {10}}} with every living creature that is with you, with the birds, the cattle, and every wild animal that is with you of all that have gone out of the ark, even with every beast of the earth.
 This {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {11}}} is my solemn agreement: No living thing will ever again be cut off by the waters of the flood, and there will never again  be a flood to destroy the earth.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {12}}} God said, {@Char quotedblleft}This is the symbol of the solemn agreement that I make for all time between me and you and every living creature that is with you:
 I {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {13}}} have placed my bow in the cloud and it shall be the symbol of the solemn agreement between me and the inhabitants of the earth.
 Whenever {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {14}}} I bring a cloud over the earth and the bow is seen in the cloud,
 I {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {15}}} will remember the agreement which is between me and you and every living creature; and the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all living things.
 Whenever {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {16}}} the bow is seen in the cloud, I will see it and remember the everlasting agreement between God and every living creature on earth,{@Char quotedblright}
 God {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {17}}} said to Noah, {@Char quotedblleft}it is the sign of the solemn agreement which I have made with everything that lives on earth.{@Char quotedblright}

 Say {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {13}}} you are my sister, so that everything may go well for me because of you and  my life will be spared.{@Char quotedblright}
 W {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {14}}} hen Abram arrived in Egypt, the Egyptians saw that Serai was very beautiful.
 The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {15}}} officials of Pharaoh, when they saw her, praised her to Pharaoh, and she was taken into Pharaoh's household.
 He {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {16}}} treated Abram well for her sake. He had sheep, and oxen and donkeys, and male and female slaves, and she-donkeys, and camels.
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {17}}} the  {@S {Lord }} sent great plagues to Pharaoh and his household because of Sarai, Abram's wife.
 Pharaoh {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {18}}} called Abram and said, {@Char quotedblleft}What is this that you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife?
 Why {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {19}}} did you say, {@Char quoteleft}She is my sister,{@Char quoteright} so that I took her to be my wife? Here she is, take her and go.{@Char quotedblright}
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {20}}} Pharaoh gave his men orders to send him on his way with his wife and all his possessions.
 

@PP
So {@OuterNote { 10.5p @Font {@B 13}}} Abram and his wife and all his possessions left Egypt and went to the Negreb and Lot went with him.
 Abram {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {2}}} was now very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.
 He {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {3}}} journeyed on from the Negreb in stages towards Bethel, to the place where he had earlier pitched his tent between Bethel and Ai
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {4}}} had set up the alter to worship the 
 {@S {Lord }} . 

@PP
Lot, {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {5}}} who went with Abram, also had so many flocks and herds and tents
 that {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {6}}} the land was not fertile enough to support them both. They had too many animals to live in the same place.
 At {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {7}}} that time, the Canaanites and Perizzites were living in the land. So when there was a quarrel between Lot's herdsmen and Abram's herdsmen,
 Abram {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {8}}} said to Lot, {@Char quotedblleft}There should be no quarrels between me and you, or between my herdsmen and yours, because we are relatives.
 Is {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {9}}} not the whole land before you? Let's separate. If you go to the left, then I will go to the right; or if you go to the right, then I will go to the left.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {10}}} Lot looked about and saw that all the plain of the Jordan, as far as Zoar, was well watered everywhere, like a garden of the 
 {@S {Lord }} . (This was before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.)
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {11}}} Lot chose for himself all the valley of the Jordan and went on to the east; and they separated from one another.
 Abram {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {12}}} lived in the land of Canaan and Lot lived in the cities of the plain and moved his tent as far as Sodom.
 (But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {13}}} the men of Sodom were very wicked and sinned against the 
 {@S {Lord }} .) 

@PP
The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {14}}}  {@S {Lord }} said to Abram, after Lot had gone away from him, {@Char quotedblleft}Lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are northward, southward, eastward and westward,
 for {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {15}}} all the land that you see I will give to you and to your descendants forever.
 I {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {16}}} will make your descendants as many as the dust of the earth, so that if someone could count the dust of the earth, then your descendants could also be counted.
 Rise, {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {17}}} walk through the length and breadth of the land, for I will give it to you.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {18}}} Abraham moved his tent and lived in the oak grove of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar to the

 Now {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {10}}} the valley of Siddim is full of bitumen pits; so when the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, they fell into them, but those who remained fled to the mountain.

 When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {14}}} Abram heard that his kinsman had been taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far as Dan.
 Then, {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {15}}} dividing his band in order to attack the kings by night, he with his servants attacked them, and pursued them to Hobah, which is north of Damascus.
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {16}}} he brought back all the goods, and also his kinsman Lot, with his goods, as well as the women and the people.

Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {17}}} the king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return from the defeat of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, at the valley of Shaveh (that is, the King's Vale).
 Melchizedek {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {18}}} king of Salem also brought out bread and wine; and he was priest of God Most High.

 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {3}}} he urged them so strongly that they went with him and entered his house. And he made a feast for them and baked bread made without yeast, and they ate.
 

@PP
But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {4}}} before they had lain down, the people of Sodom, both young and old, all the people from every quarter, surrounded the house.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {5}}} they called out to Lot, {@Char quotedblleft}Where are the men who came in to you tonight? Bring them out to us so we can rape them.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {6}}} Lot went out to them at the entrance of his house, but he shut the door after him.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {7}}} he said, {@Char quotedblleft}I beg of you, my friends, do not do what is wrong.
 See, {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {8}}} I have two unmarried daughters; let me bring them out to you, and do to them as you desire; only do nothing to these men, for they have come under the shadow of my roof.{@Char quotedblright}
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {9}}} they replied, {@Char quotedblleft}Stand back!{@Char quotedblright} And they added, {@Char quotedblleft}This one came in as a foreigner to live here, but now he would set himself up as a judge! We will treat you worse than them.{@Char quotedblright} And they pressed hard against Lot and advanced to break the door.
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {10}}} the men reached out and drew Lot to them into the house and shut the door.
 Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {11}}} they struck the men who were at the door of the house, both small and great, with blindness, so that they grew tired of searching for the door.
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {12}}} the men said to Lot, {@Char quotedblleft}Have you any one else here? Bring your sons-in-law, your sons, and daughters, and whoever you have in the city out of this place,
 for {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {13}}} we are about to destroy it, because great complaint concerning the people has come to the 
 {@S {Lord }} and he has sent us to destroy it.{@Char quotedblright} So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {14}}} Lot went out and said to his sons-in-law, {@Char quotedblleft}Up, go out of this place, for the 
 {@S {Lord }} will destroy the city.{@Char quotedblright} But his sons-in-law thought he was only jesting.
 

@PP
When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {15}}} the dawn appeared, the messengers urged Lot, saying, {@Char quotedblleft}Get up, take your wife and your two daughters that you may not be swept away in the punishment of the city.{@Char quotedblright}
 When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {16}}} he hesitated, the men grabbed him by the hand and led him and his wife and his two daughters outside the city, for the 
 {@S {Lord }} was merciful to him. 

@PP
When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {17}}} they had brought them outside, they said, {@Char quotedblleft}Run for your life; do not look behind you nor stay anywhere in the plain. Escape to the heights, that you may not be swept away!{@Char quotedblright}
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {18}}} Lot said to them, {@Char quotedblleft}Oh, sirs, not so!
 See, {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {19}}} your servant has found favor with you, and you have shown great mercy to me in saving my life. I cannot escape to the heights, lest some evil overtake me, and I die.
 See {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {20}}} now, this village is near enough to run to, and it is small. Oh, let me escape there, and my life will be saved.{@Char quotedblright}
 He {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {21}}} answered, {@Char quotedblleft}I have also granted you this favor, in that I will not destroy the village of which you have spoken.
 Make {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {22}}} haste, escape to it, for I can do nothing until you arrive there.{@Char quotedblright} Therefore the village was called Zoar.
 

@PP
The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {23}}} sun had risen when Lot came to Zoar.
 Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {24}}} the  {@S {Lord }} caused brimstone and fire from heaven to rain upon Sodom and Gomorrah,
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {25}}} he destroyed those cities and all the plain, with all the people who lived in it and all that grew on the ground.
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {26}}} Lot's wife, who was following him, looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.
 

@PP
Early {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {27}}} in the morning Abraham rose and went to the place where he had stood before the 
 {@S {Lord }} ; and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {28}}} as he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah and all the plain, he saw the smoke of the land going up as the smoke of a smelting-furnace.
 God {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {29}}} had remembered Abraham when he destroyed the cities of the plain and rescued Lot from the destruction.

 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {3}}} God came to Abimelech in a dream in the night and said to him, {@Char quotedblleft}You will die, because of the woman you have taken, for she is married.
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {4}}} Abimelech had not come near her; so he said, Lord, will you slay an innocent people?
 Did {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {5}}} Abraham not himself say to me, {@Char quoteleft}She is my sister?{@Char quoteright} And even she herself said, {@Char quoteleft}He is my brother.{@Char quoteright} I acted innocently and in good faith.{@Char quotedblright}
 Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {6}}} God said to him in the dream, {@Char quotedblleft}I  know that you acted innocently and in good faith, and I also prevented you from sinning against me, since I did not allow you to touch her.
 Now {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {7}}} you must restore the man's wife -- for he is a prophet and he can intercede for you, and you will live. But if you do not restore her  at once, you will die, together with all your people.{@Char quotedblright}

 Abimelech {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {10}}} said to Abraham, {@Char quotedblleft}What was your purpose in doing this thing?{@Char quotedblright}
 Abraham {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {11}}} answered, {@Char quotedblleft}Because I thought, {@Char quoteleft}Surely the fear of God is not in this place and they will slay me for my wife's sake.{@Char quoteright}
 Moreover, {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {12}}} she really is  my sister, the daughter of my father, though not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.

 Abraham {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {5}}} was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born.

 This {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {11}}} request was very displeasing to Abraham because the boy was his son.

 Meanwhile {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {21}}} the man was silently gazing at her in order to find out whether the 
 {@S {Lord }} had made his journey successful or not. 

@PP
As {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {22}}} soon as the camels had finished drinking, the man took a gold ring, half a shekel in weight, and put it in her nose, and put on her arms two golden bracelets weighing ten shekels,
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {23}}} said, {@Char quotedblleft}Whose daughter are you? Tell me, I beg of you. Is there room in your father's house for us to spend the night?{@Char quotedblright}
 She {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {24}}} answered, {@Char quotedblleft}I am the daughter of Bethuel son of of Milcah and Nahor.
 We {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {25}}} have plenty of straw and feed, and there is a place for you to spend the night.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {26}}} the man bowed his head and worshipped the 
 {@S {Lord }},  {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {27}}} saying, {@Char quotedblleft}Blessed be the 
 {@S {Lord }}, the God of my master Abraham, who has continued to show his mercy and his faithfulness toward my master. As for me, the 
 {@S { Lord }} has led me on the way to the house of my master's relatives.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {28}}} the young woman ran and told these things to her mother's family.
 Now {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {29}}} Rebekah had a brother named Laban; and Laban ran out to the man at the spring.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {30}}} when he saw the bracelets on his sister's hands and the ring, and when he heard Rebekah say, {@Char quotedblleft}This is what the man said to me,{@Char quotedblright} he went to the man, who was still standing by the camels at the spring,
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {31}}} said, {@Char quotedblleft}Come in, you who are blessed by the 
 {@S {Lord }} ! Why do you stand outside? For I have cleared the house and have room for the camels.{@Char quotedblright}
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {32}}} he brought the man into the house and took the packs off the camels and furnished straw and feed for them, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.
 

@PP
But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {33}}} when food was set before him to eat, he said, {@Char quotedblleft}I will not eat until I have made known my errand.{@Char quotedblright} They answered, {@Char quotedblleft}Speak.{@Char quotedblright}
 He {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {34}}} said, {@Char quotedblleft}I am Abraham's servant;
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {35}}} the  {@S {Lord }} has blessed my master greatly, so that he has become very rich. He has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, servants, and camels and donkeys.
 Now {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {36}}} Sarah, my master's wife, had a son when she was old, and my master has given him all that he has.
 My {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {37}}} master also made me promise, saying, {@Char quoteleft}Do not let my son marry one of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live,
 but {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {38}}} go to my father's home and to my relatives and there find a wife for my son.{@Char quoteright}
 

@PP
{@Char quotedblleft}When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {39}}} I said to my master, {@Char quoteleft}What if the woman will not follow me?{@Char quoteright}
 he {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {40}}} said to me, {@Char quoteleft}The  {@S {
Lord }}, whom I love and serve, will send his messenger with you and make you successful, and you will find for my son a wife from among my relatives and my father's family.
  {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {41}}} Then you will be free from your promise to me. But if you go to my family and they do not give her to you, you shall also be free from your promise to me.{@Char quoteright}
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {42-43}}} I came today to the spring and said, {@Char quoteleft}
 {@S {Lord }}, God of my master Abraham, see, I am standing by the spring of water. If you will make the errand on which I am going successful, then let the young woman who comes to draw, to whom I say, {@Char quoteleft}Please give me a little water from your jar to drink{@Char quoteright},
  {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {44}}} and who shall say to me, {@Char quoteleft}Drink, and I will also draw for your camels{@Char quoteright}, let that one be the woman whom the 
 {@S {Lord }} has chosen for my master's son.{@Char quoteright} 

@PP
{@Char quotedblleft}Even {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {45}}} before I was through speaking, Rebekah came out with her water-jar on her shoulder and went down to the spring and drew water. And when I said to her, {@Char quoteleft}Please let me drink,{@Char quoteright}
 she {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {46}}} quickly let down her water-jar from her shoulder and answered, {@Char quoteleft}Drink, and I will also water your camels.{@Char quoteright} So I drank, and she also watered the camels.
 Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {47}}} I asked her, {@Char quoteleft}Whose daughter are you?{@Char quoteright} And she said, {@Char quoteleft}The daughter of Bethuel son of Nahor and Milcah.{@Char quoteright} So I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her arms.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {48}}} I bowed my head and worshipped and blessed the 
 {@S {Lord }} God of my master Abraham who had led me on the right way to find the daughter of my master's brother for his son.
 Tell {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {49}}} me whether or not you will deal kindly and truly with my master, so that I shall know what to do!{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {50}}} Laban and his family answered, {@Char quotedblleft}The matter is in the hands of the 
 {@S {Lord }} . We cannot say either {@Char quoteleft}yes{@Char quoteright} or {@Char quoteleft}no.{@Char quoteright}
 See, {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {51}}} Rebekah is before you; take her and go and let her be the wife of your master's son, as the 
 {@S {Lord }} has said.{@Char quotedblright} 

@PP
When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {52}}} Abraham's servant heard their words, he bowed to the ground before the 
 {@S {Lord }} . Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {53}}} he brought out gold and silver ornaments and clothing and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave costly gifts to her brother and to her mother.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {54}}} he and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night there.
 

@PP
When they rose in the morning, the servant said, {@Char quotedblleft}Send me away to my master.{@Char quotedblright}
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {55}}} Rebekah's brother and mother answered, {@Char quotedblleft}Let the young woman stay with us a month or at least ten days; after that she may go.{@Char quotedblright}
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {56}}} he said to them, {@Char quotedblleft}Do not delay me, for the 
 {@S {Lord }} has given me success. Send me away that I may go to my master.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {57}}} they said, {@Char quotedblleft}We will call the young woman and ask her.{@Char quotedblright}
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {58}}} they called Rebekah and said to her, {@Char quotedblleft}Will you go with this man?{@Char quotedblright} She answered, {@Char quotedblleft}I will go.{@Char quotedblright}
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {59}}} they sent away their sister Rebekah and her nurse with Abraham's servant and his men.
 

@PP
They {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {60}}} also blessed Rebekah, saying to her, {@Char quotedblleft}Our sister! May your children and their children become thousands and thousands, may your sons conquer the cities of their enemies!{@Char quotedblright}
 Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {61}}} Rebekah set out with her maids and, riding upon the camels, they followed the man. So the servant took Rebekah and went away.
 

@PP
Now {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {62}}} Isaac had come from Beer-lahai-roi, and was settled in the Negeb.
 In {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {63}}} the evening, when Isaac had gone out for a walk in the field, he looked up and saw camels coming.
 Rebekah {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {64}}} too looked up, and when she saw Isaac, she quickly alighted from the camel
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {65}}} said to the servant, {@Char quotedblleft}Who is this man walking in the field to meet us?{@Char quotedblright} When the servant said, {@Char quotedblleft}It is my master,{@Char quotedblright} she took her veil and covered her face.
 Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {66}}} the servant told Isaac all that he had done.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {67}}} Isaac brought Rebekah to the tent of Sarah his mother, and she became his wife; and he loved her. So Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.

Isaac {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {21}}} prayed to the  {@S {Lord }} for his wife, because she had no children; and the

 The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {22}}} children struggled against each other in her womb, and she said, {@Char quotedblleft}Why is this happening to me? What does it mean?{@Char quotedblright} She went to ask the

When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {24}}} the time came for her to give birth, she became the mother of twin boys.

{@S {Now {@OuterNote { 10.5p @Font {@B 26}}} when a famine came in the land,}}  (not the first famine that was in the days of Abraham), Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines at Gerar.
 

@PP
And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {2}}} the  {@S {Lord }} appeared to him and said, {@Char quotedblleft}Go not down into Egypt; settle in the land of which I will tell you,
 stay {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {3}}} in this land, and I will be with you and will bless you; for to you, and to your descendants, I will give all these lands, and will establish the oath which I swore to Abraham your father:
 I {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {4}}} will make your descendants as many as the stars of heaven, and give to your descendants all these lands; and all the nations of the earth will invoke for themselves a blessing like that of your descendants,
 because {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {5}}} Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.{@Char quotedblright}
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {6}}} Isaac settled in Gerar. 

@PP
The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {7}}} men of the place asked him about his wife; and he said, {@Char quotedblleft}She is my sister{@Char quotedblright}; for he was afraid to say {@Char quotedblleft}my wife{@Char quotedblright}; lest the men of the place kill him for Rebekah; because she was beautiful to look at.
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {8}}} after he had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines  looked out of the window, and saw Isaac just as he was caressing Rebekah his wife.
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {9}}} Abimelech called to Isaac, and said, {@Char quotedblleft}Surely  she is your wife;  why did you say {@Char quoteleft}She is my sister?{@Char quoteright}{@Char quotedblright} Isaac answered him, {@Char quotedblleft}I said it, so that I might not die because of her.{@Char quotedblright}
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {10}}} Abimelech said, {@Char quotedblleft}What is this you have done to us? One of the people might have lain with your wife and so you would have brought guilt upon us.{@Char quotedblright}
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {11}}} Abimelech warned all the people, saying, {@Char quotedblleft}The person who touches this man or his wife will be put to death.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {12}}} Isaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year an increase of a hundredfold, for the 
 {@S {Lord }} blessed him. And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {13}}} the man became rich, and grew richer and richer until he became very wealthy; for he had many flocks, and many herds, and a great household; so that the Philistines envied him.
 

@PP
Now {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {14}}} all the wells which Isaac's father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth.
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {15}}} Isaac dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father -- for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham and he gave them the same names as his father had given them.
 

@PP
Abimelech {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {16}}} said to Isaac, {@Char quotedblleft}Go from us; for you are much mightier than we are.{@Char quotedblright}
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {17}}} Isaac departed, and encamped in the valley of Gerar, and settled there.
 Isaac {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {18}}} reopened the wells which had been dug in the days of his father Abraham and stopped by the Philistines after his death. He called them by the names his father had given them.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {19}}} when Isaac's slaves dug in the valley, they found there a well of spring water.
 The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {20}}} herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, {@Char quotedblleft}The water is ours.{@Char quotedblright} So he called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {21}}} when they dug another well, they quarreled over that also. So he called the name of it Sitnah.
 He {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {22}}} moved on from these and dug another well; and over that one there was no dispute. So he called  it Rehoboth, and said, {@Char quotedblleft}For now the

@PP
Isaac {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {23}}} went up from there to Beer-sheba.

 Isaac {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {25}}} built an altar there, and called upon the name of the

@PP
 {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {26}}} Then Abimelech came to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his army.
 Isaac {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {27}}} said to them, {@Char quotedblleft}Why have you come to me, since you hated me and have driven me away from you?{@Char quotedblright}
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {28}}} they said, {@Char quotedblleft}We saw plainly that the

 {@Char quoteleft}Bring {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {7}}} me venison and prepare for me savory food that I may eat it and bless you before I die.{@Char quoteright}

 Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {10}}} take it to him, that he may eat, so that he may bless you before he dies.{@Char quotedblright}
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {11}}} Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, {@Char quotedblleft}You know that my brother Esau is a hairy man, while I am smooth.
 Perhaps {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {12}}} my father will touch me; then I will appear to him to be a deceiver, and I will bring blame upon me and not a blessing.{@Char quotedblright}

Rebekah {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {15}}} also took the fine clothes of her older son Esau, which she had with her in the tent, and put them on her younger son Jacob.

 Jacob {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {19}}} said, {@Char quotedblleft}I am Esau your oldest son. I have done as you commanded me. Sit up and eat some of my venison, so that you may bless me.{@Char quotedblright}

 Esau {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {36}}} said, {@Char quotedblleft}He was correctly named Jacob.  He has supplanted me these two times: he took my birthright, and now he has taken my blessing!{@Char quotedblright} Then he said, {@Char quotedblleft}Have you kept a blessing for me?{@Char quotedblright}
 Isaac {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {37}}} answered Esau, {@Char quotedblleft}I have made him your master and I have given to him all his relatives as slaves and grain and wine as his food. What then can I do for you, my son?{@Char quotedblright}
 Esau {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {38}}} said to his father, {@Char quotedblleft}Is that the only blessing you have, my father? Father, bless me too!{@Char quotedblright} and Esau began to weep aloud.
 Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {39}}} Isaac his father answered him:

Esau {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {41}}} hated Jacob because of the blessing which his father had given him. And Esau said to himself, {@Char quotedblleft}My father will soon die; then I will kill Jacob, my brother.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {42}}} the words of her older son Esau were told to Rebekah, she sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him, {@Char quotedblleft}Your brother, Esau, is going to kill you.
 Now, {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {43}}} my son, listen to me: run away to my brother Laban at Haran
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {44}}} stay with him for a time until your brother is no longer angry
 -- {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {45}}} until he is no longer angry and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send and bring you back. Why should I lose both of you in one day?{@Char quotedblright}

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 10.5p @Font {@B 28}}} Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and instructed him, {@Char quotedblleft}You must not marry any of the daughters of Canaan.
 Arise, {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {2}}} go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother's father; and marry one of the daughters of Laban, your mother's brother.

@LP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {10}}} Jacob set out from Beersheba and went toward Haran.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {11}}} when he arrived at a certain holy place, he passed the night there, because the sun had set. And he took one of the stones from its place and put it under his head and lay down to sleep.
 Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {12}}} he dreamed and saw a ladder set up on the earth, and its top reached to heaven; and the messengers of God were going up and down on it.
 

@PP
The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {13}}}  {@S {Lord }} also stood beside him and said, {@Char quotedblleft}I am the 
 {@S {Lord }}, God of Abraham and God of Isaac. The land on which you lie I will give to you and to your children.
  {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {14}}} And your descendants will be as countless as the dust of the earth and you will spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south, and all the families of the earth will wish for a blessing like yours and that of your descendants.
 See, {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {15}}} I am with you, and will keep you wherever you go and will bring you again to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.{@Char quotedblright}

So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {18}}} Jacob rose early in the morning and took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up as a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it.

 Jacob {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {20}}} also made this promise, {@Char quotedblleft}If God will be with me and protect me on this journey which I am making and give me bread to eat and clothing to put on,

{@S {Jacob {@OuterNote { 10.5p @Font {@B 29}}} continued on his journey and arrived at the land of the}} people of the East.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {2}}} he looked and saw a well in the field, and there were three flocks of sheep lying down by it; for from that well they watered the flocks; but there was a large stone over the well.
 When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {3}}} all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds used to roll away the stone and water the sheep and then put the stone back in its place over the well.
 

@PP
Jacob {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {4}}} said to the men, {@Char quotedblleft}My friends, from where do you come?{@Char quotedblright} They said, {@Char quotedblleft}We are from Haran.{@Char quotedblright}
 Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {5}}} he said to them, {@Char quotedblleft}Do you know Laban the son of Nahor?{@Char quotedblright} And they said, {@Char quotedblleft}We know him.{@Char quotedblright}
 He {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {6}}} said to them, {@Char quotedblleft}Is all well with him?{@Char quotedblright} And they said, {@Char quotedblleft}All is well; indeed, this is Rachel his daughter coming with the sheep.{@Char quotedblright}
 H {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {7}}} e said, {@Char quotedblleft}See, the sun is still high! It is not time for the cattle to be gathered together. Water the sheep and feed them.{@Char quotedblright}
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {8}}} they said, {@Char quotedblleft}We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together, and they roll away the stone from the well; then we will water the sheep.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
While {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {9}}} he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep; for she was a shepherdess.
 When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {10}}} Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban, his mother's brother, and Laban's sheep, he went up and rolled the stone from the well and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.
 Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {11}}} Jacob kissed Rachel and wept aloud.
 When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {12}}} Jacob told Rachel that he was a relative of her father and that he was Rebekah's son, she ran and told her father.
 

@PP
As {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {13}}} soon as Laban heard about Jacob, his sister's son, he ran to meet him, put his arms around him, kissed him many times, and brought him to his home. When Jacob told Laban all that had happened,
 Laban {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {14}}} said to him, {@Char quotedblleft}Surely you are my bone and my flesh.{@Char quotedblright} So he remained with him a whole month.
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {15}}} Laban said to Jacob, {@Char quotedblleft}Should you serve me for nothing simply because you are related to me? Tell me what shall be your wages?{@Char quotedblright}
 Now {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {16}}} Laban had two daughters: the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.
 Leah's {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {17}}} eyes were dull, but Rachel was beautiful.
 Jacob {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {18}}} loved Rachel, and so he said, {@Char quotedblleft}I will serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter.{@Char quotedblright}
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {19}}} Laban said, {@Char quotedblleft}It is better for me to give her to you than to give her to any other man. Stay with me.{@Char quotedblright}
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {20}}} Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him but a few days, because he loved her so.
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {21}}} Jacob said to Laban, {@Char quotedblleft}Give me my wife, for my time is up, and let me marry her.{@Char quotedblright}
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {22}}} Laban gathered all the men of the place and made a feast.
 In {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {23}}} the evening he took Leah his daughter and brought her to Jacob, and Jacob received her as his wife.
 At {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {24}}} the same time Laban gave his slave-girl Zilpah to his daughter Leah.
 

@PP
When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {25}}} in the morning Jacob found it was Leah, he said to Laban, {@Char quotedblleft}What is this you have done to me? Did I not serve you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?{@Char quotedblright}
 Laban {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {26}}} said, {@Char quotedblleft}It is not the custom among us to give the younger in marriage before the older.
 Remain {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {27}}} with this one during the marriage week, then we will give you the other also for the service which you will give me during seven more years.{@Char quotedblright}
 Jacob {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {28}}} did so: he remained with Leah during the marriage week. Then Laban gave him Rachel his daughter to be his wife,
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {29}}} his slave-girl Bilhah to serve Rachel.
 Jacob {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {30}}} slept with Rachel as well, and loved Rachel more than Leah. So he had to serve Laban seven years more.
 

@PP
When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {31}}} the  {@S {Lord }} saw that Leah was spurned, he gave her the gift of motherhood; Rachel, however, was barren.
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {32}}} Leah gave birth to a son whom she named Reuben; for she said, {@Char quotedblleft}The 
 {@S {Lord }} has seen my affliction; now my husband will love me.{@Char quotedblright}
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {33}}} she gave birth to another son; and said, {@Char quotedblleft}Because the 
 {@S {Lord }} has heard that I am spurned, he has given me this one also{@Char quotedblright}; and she called his name Simeon.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {34}}} she gave birth to another son and said, {@Char quotedblleft}Now this time my husband will become attached to me because I have borne him three sons{@Char quotedblright}; therefore his name was called Levi.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {35}}} she gave birth to another son and said, {@Char quotedblleft}This time I will praise the 
 {@S {Lord }} {@Char quotedblright}; therefore she called his name Judah then she stopped having children.
 

@PP
And {@OuterNote { 10.5p @Font {@B 30}}} when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, she was jealous of her sister and said to Jacob, {@Char quotedblleft}Give me children or else I will die.{@Char quotedblright}
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {2}}} Jacob's anger was aroused against Rachel, and he said, {@Char quotedblleft}Am I in God's place? Who has withheld offspring from you?{@Char quotedblright}
 She {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {3}}} said, {@Char quotedblleft}Here is my slave-girl Bilhah, go to her, so that she may bear sons who can be laid on my knees and I also may obtain children though her.{@Char quotedblright}
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {4}}} so she gave him Bilhah her slave-girl for a wife, and Jacob slept with her.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {5}}} when Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son,
 Rachel {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {6}}} said, {@Char quotedblleft}God has judged me and has also heard my voice and has given me a son.{@Char quotedblright} So she called his name Dan.
 

@PP
And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {7}}} Bilhah, Rachel's slave-girl conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {8}}} Rachel said, {@Char quotedblleft}With superhuman wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and have prevailed{@Char quotedblright}; so she called his name Naphtali.
 

@PP
When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {9}}} Leah saw that she had stopped having children, she took Zilpah her slave-girl, and gave her to Jacob as a wife.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {10}}} Zilpah, Leah's slave-girl bore Jacob a son.
 Leah {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {11}}} said, {@Char quotedblleft}Fortunate!{@Char quotedblright} and she called his name Gad.
 Zilpah {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {12}}} bore Jacob a second son, and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {13}}} Leah said, {@Char quotedblleft}Happy am I! Now women will call me happy{@Char quotedblright}, and she called his name Asher.
 

@PP
One {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {14}}} time, during the wheat harvest, Reuben went  and found mandrakes in the field and brought them to his mother Leah.  Rachel asked Leah, {@Char quotedblleft}Please give me some of your son's mandrakes.{@Char quotedblright}
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {15}}} Leah said to her, {@Char quotedblleft}Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband, that you would also take away my son's mandrakes?{@Char quotedblright}  Rachel said, {@Char quotedblleft}In exchange for your son's mandrakes, Jacob can sleep with you tonight.{@Char quotedblright}
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {16}}} when Jacob came from the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him, and said, {@Char quotedblleft}You sleep with me tonight, for I have hired you with my son's mandrakes.{@Char quotedblright} So he slept with her that night.
 

@PP
And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {17}}} God heard Leah's prayer, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son.
 Leah {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {18}}} said, {@Char quotedblleft}God has given me my reward, because I gave my slave-girl to my husband{@Char quotedblright}; so she called his name Issachar.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {19}}} Leah conceived again, and bore a sixth son to Jacob.
 She {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {20}}} said, {@Char quotedblleft}God has endowed me with a good dowry; now  my husband willhonor me, because I have borne him six sons{@Char quotedblright}; and she called him Zebulun.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {21}}} afterwards she had a daughter and named her Dinah.
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {22}}} God remembered Rachel and heard her prayer and gave her a child.
 She {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {23}}} conceived and gave birth to a son and said, {@Char quotedblleft}God has taken away my disgrace.{@Char quotedblright}
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {24}}} she called his name Joseph, saying, {@Char quotedblleft}The 
 {@S {Lord }} will add to me another son.{@Char quotedblright} 

@PP
W {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {25}}} hen Rachel had given birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, {@Char quotedblleft}Send me away, so that I may go to my own place, and to my country.
 Give {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {26}}} me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, so that I may go; for you know the service which I have rendered you.{@Char quotedblright}
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {27}}} Laban said to him, {@Char quotedblleft}If now I have found favor in your eyes -- I have divined that the 
 {@S {Lord }} has blessed me for your sake. State {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {28}}} exactly to me your wages and I will pay them.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
Jacob {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {29}}} answered him, {@Char quotedblleft}You know how I have served you and what your cattle have become under my care;
 for {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {30}}} it was little which you had before I came, but now it has greatly increased, since the 
 {@S {Lord }} has blessed you wherever I went. But now, when am I to provide for my own house as well?{@Char quotedblright}
 Laban {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {31}}} said, {@Char quotedblleft}What should I give you?{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
And Jacob said, {@Char quotedblleft}You do not need to give me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will again feed your flock; I will again keep it.
 If {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {32}}} I can go through all your flock today, and remove from it every black one among the lambs and the spotted and speckled among the goats; these will be my wages.
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {33}}}  my honesty will testify for me later, when you come to inspect my wages: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and black among the lambs has been stolen by me.{@Char quotedblright}
 Laban {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {34}}} said, {@Char quotedblleft}Good, let it be as you say.{@Char quotedblright}
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {35}}} he removed that day the he-goats that were striped and spotted, and all the she-goats that were striped and spotted, every one that had white on it, and all the black ones among the lambs, and gave them into the hands of his sons.
 Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {36}}} he put the distance of a three days' journey between himself and Jacob; and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.
 

@PP
Jacob, {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {37}}} howver, took fresh rods of white poplar, and of the almond and of the plane tree, and peeled white streaks in them, exposing the white which was in the rods.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {38}}} he set the rods which he had peeled before the flocks in the watering-troughs where the flocks came to drink (and they conceived when they came to drink)
 so {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {39}}} that the flocks conceived before the rods. Therefore the flocks brought forth striped, speckled and spotted offspring.
 Jacob {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {40}}} separated the lambs, and he set the faces of the flocks toward the striped and the black animals in the flock of Laban and he put his own droves apart and did not put them near Laban's flock.
 

@PP
And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {41}}} whenever the stronger animals of the flock conceived, Jacob laid the rods in the troughs before the eyes of the flock, so that they might conceive among the rods.
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {42}}} when the animals were weakly, he did not put them in.
 In this way the more weakly became Laban's, and the stronger Jacobs's.
 

@PP
So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {43}}} the man increased in wealth exceedingly, and had large flocks, and male and female slaves, and camels and donkeys.
 

@PP
Now {@OuterNote { 10.5p @Font {@B 31}}} Jacob heard Laban's sons say, {@Char quotedblleft}Jacob has taken all that was our father's, and from that which was our father's he has acquired all these riches.{@Char quotedblright}
 Now {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {2}}} Jacob observed that  Laban was not so favorably inclined to him as formerly.
 The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {3}}}  {@S {Lord }} said to Jacob, {@Char quotedblleft}Return to the land of your ancestors, and to your relatives, and I will be with you.{@Char quotedblright}
 Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {4}}} Jacob sent for Rachel and Leah to come to the field where his flocks were,
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {5}}} said to them, {@Char quotedblleft}I see that your father is not so favorably inclined toward me as formerly; but the God of my father has been with me.
 You {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {6}}} know that I have served your father with all my strength.
 Your {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {7}}} father, however, has deceived me and changed my wages ten times; but God has not allowed him to do me harm.
 If {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {8}}} your father said, {@Char quoteleft}The speckled will be your wages,{@Char quoteright} then all the flock bore speckled offspring, but if he said: {@Char quoteleft}The striped will be your wages,{@Char quoteright} then all the flock have striped offspring.
 God {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {9}}} has taken away the possessions of your father and given them to me.
 A {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {10}}} t the time when the flock breed,  I looked up, and saw in a dream, that the he-goats which were mating were striped, speckled, and piebald.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {11}}} the messenger of God said to me in a dream, {@Char quoteleft}Jacob!{@Char quoteright} and I said, {@Char quoteleft}Here I am.{@Char quoteright}
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {12}}} he said, {@Char quoteleft}Look! All the he-goats which are mating are striped, speckled, and piebald: for I have seen all that Laban has been doing to you.
 I {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {13}}} am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar of stone, where you made a vow to me. Now arise, leave this land, and return to the land where you were born.{@Char quoteright}{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {14}}} Rachel and Leah answered  him, {@Char quotedblleft}There is no longer any inheritance for us in our father's house.
 Are {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {15}}} we not considered as foreigners by him? For he has sold us and goes on to consume the money paid for us.
 Since {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {16}}} all the riches which God has taken away from our father is ours and our children's, do whatever God has told you to do.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {17}}} Jacob rose up and put his sons and his wives on camels,
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {18}}} drove away all his cattle and all the cattle which he had acquired in Paddan-aram, in order to go to Isaac his father, to the land of Canaan.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {19}}} while Laban was gone to shear his sheep, Rachel stole the household gods that were her father's.
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {20}}} Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean -- he did not tell him that he was going to flee.
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {21}}} he fled with all he had; crossing the river Euphrates heading towards the hill-country of Gilead.
 

@PP
When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {22}}} it was reported to Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled,
 he {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {23}}} took his tribesmen with him, and pursued  him for seven days, and overtook him in the hill country of Gilead.
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {24}}} God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night, and said to him, {@Char quotedblleft}Take care  that you do not speak to Jacob either good or bad.{@Char quotedblright}
 When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {25}}} Laban caught up with Jacob, Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country; and Laban with his relatives encamped in same hill country of Gilead.
 

@PP
Laban {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {26}}} said to Jacob, {@Char quotedblleft}What have you done?  You have deceived me and carried away my daughters like captives of war!
 Why {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {27}}} did you flee secretly, stealing away from me without telling me?  I would have sent you away with mirth and with songs, with tambourine and with harp --
 but {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {28}}} you did not allow me to kiss my sons and daughters. You have acted foolishly.
 It {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {29}}} was in my power to do you harm, but the God of your father spoke to me last night saying, {@Char quoteleft}Take care that you do not speak to Jacob, neither good nor bad.{@Char quoteright}
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {30}}} now, since you are surely going because you long so earnestly for your father's house, why have you stolen my gods?{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
Jacob {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {31}}} answered Laban,  {@Char quotedblleft}I was afraid, for I thought you would take your daughters from me by force.
 The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {32}}} one with whom you find your gods will be put to death; in the presence of our kinsmen investigate for yourself what is with me and take it.{@Char quotedblright} Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen Laban's gods.
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {33}}} Laban went into Jacob's tent and into Leah's, and into the tent of the two slave-girls, but he did not find his gods. Then he went out of Leah's tent, and entered Rachel's.
 Now {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {34}}} Rachel had taken the household gods and put them in the camel's saddle and was sitting on them, so that when Laban had searched all about the tent, he did not find them.
 She {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {35}}} said to her father, {@Char quotedblleft}Do not be angry that I cannot rise before you, my lord, for it is that time of the month that women have.{@Char quotedblright} And though he searched thoroughly, he did not find the household gods.
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {36}}} Jacob became angry and challenged Laban. {@Char quotedblleft}What is my crime?{@Char quotedblright} he said, {@Char quotedblleft}What is my offense, that you have pursued hotly after me?
 Alhough {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {37}}} you have gone through all through my things, what have you found of all your household possessions? Declare it here before my kinsmen and yours, so that they may decide which of us two is in the right.
 In {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {38}}} all these twenty years that have I been with you, your ewes and she-goats have not miscarried their young, neither did I eat the rams of your flocks.
 I {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {39}}} did not bring to you the animals which were killed by wild beasts; I bore the loss of it myself; from my hand you required compensation, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.
 This {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {40}}} was how I was: in the day the heat consumed me, and by night the frost, and  sleep deserted me.
 These {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {41}}} twenty years  I have been in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times.
 Unless {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {42}}} the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely by now you would have sent me away empty. But God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and he rebuked you last night.{@Char quotedblright}

Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {43}}} Laban answered Jacob, {@Char quotedblleft}The daughters are my daughters, and the children are my grandchildren, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine, but what can I do today for these my daughters, or for their children whom they have borne?
 Come, {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {44}}} let us make a solemn agreement, I and you, and let there be a witness between me and you.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {45}}} Jacob took a stone, and set it up as a pillar,
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {46}}} said to the members of his family, {@Char quotedblleft}Gather stones.{@Char quotedblright} And when they had taken stones and made a heap, they ate there by the heap.
 Laban {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {47}}} called it Jegar-sahaduthap; but Jacob called it Galeed.
 {@Char quotedblleft}This {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {48}}} heap{@Char quotedblright}, Laban said, {@Char quotedblleft}is witness between me and you today.{@Char quotedblright} This is why it was called Galeed,
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {49}}}  Mizpah, for Laban said, {@Char quotedblleft}May the 
 {@S {Lord }} watch between me and you when we are absent one from another,
 so {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {50}}} that you may not maltreat my daughters nor take other wives besides my daughters. No one is with us; but beware: God is witness between me and you.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
Moreover, {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {51}}} Laban said to Jacob, {@Char quotedblleft}See this heap, and  the pillar which I have set up between me and you.
 This {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {52}}} heap is a witness and the pillar is a witness that I should not pass beyond this heap to you and that you must not pass beyond this heap and this pillar to me, with hostile intent.
 The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {53}}} God of Abraham and the God of Nahor{@Char quotedblright} (the God of their ancestors) {@Char quotedblleft}judge between us.{@Char quotedblright} And Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac.

And {@OuterNote { 10.5p @Font {@B 32}}} Jacob went on his way and the messengers of God met him.

 Remember {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {12}}} your promise to make me prosper and my descendants as many as the sand of the seashore, uncountable.{@Char quotedblright}

After {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {13}}} spending the night there, Jacob took from his livestock as a present for his brother Esau,

 thirty {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {15}}} milch camels and their young, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten young donkeys.
 These {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {16}}} he put, each drove by itself, in the care of his servants and said to them, {@Char quotedblleft}Go on before me and leave a space between the droves.{@Char quotedblright}

 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {19}}} he bought the piece of ground where he pitched his tent from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, for four hundred shekels;
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {20}}} he erected there an altar and called it El, God of Israel.
 

@PP
And {@OuterNote { 10.5p @Font {@B 34}}} Dinah the daughter of Leah and Jacob, went out to visit the women of the region.
 When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {2}}} Sheeham the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the region, saw her, he took her and lay with her and violated her,
 but {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {3}}} his heart was drawn to Dinah the daughter of Jacob -- he loved her and spoke indearingly to her.
 Therefore {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {4}}} Shechem said to his father Hamor,  {@Char quotedblleft}Get me this girl for my wife.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {5}}} Jacob heard that Shecham had defiled Dinah his daughter, his sons were with his cattle in the field, so Jacob said nothing until they came home.
 Meanwhile {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {6}}} Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him and with his sons.
 

@PP
T {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {7}}} he sons of Jacob came in from the field, and when they heard the news, the men were indignant and became very angry, because Shechem had committed a shameful crime in raping Jacob's daughter: such a thing ought never to be done.
 Hamor {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {8}}} said to them, {@Char quotedblleft}My son Shechem has set his heart on your daughter. I beg you: give her to him as a wife
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {9}}} intermarry with us. Give your daughters to us and take our daughters for yourselves.

 Demand {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {12}}} of me an exceedingly large gift for yourselves and a dowry for the bride, and I shall give all you  ask of me; only give me the girl for my wife.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {13}}} the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, declaring, (because he had defiled their sister Dinah),
 {@Char quotedblleft}We {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {14}}} cannot do this. We cannot give our sister to someone who is uncircumcised, for that would be a disgrace to us.
 Only {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {15}}} on this condition will we make an alliance with you: if you will be as we are, in that every male of you be circumcised.
 Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {16}}} will we give our daughters to you and take your daughters to us and will live with you and we will become one people.
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {17}}} if you will not listen to us and allow yourselves to be circumcised, then we will take Dinah and be gone.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
Their {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {18}}} proposal pleased Hamor and his son Shechem.
 The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {19}}} young man (who was honored above all the house of his father) did not hesitate to do the thing demanded, because he was smitten with Jacob's daughter.
 Hamor {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {20}}} and his son Shechem  came to the gate of their city, and conversed with the men of their city, saying,
 {@Char quotedblleft}These {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {21}}} men are peaceably disposed toward us,  let them remain in the land and go about in it;  the land is broad enough for them on every side and in every direction; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.
 Only {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {22}}} on this condition will these men consent to settle with us to become one people, namely, that every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.
 Shouldn't {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {23}}} their cattle and their goods and all their beasts be ours? Let us make an alliance with them so that they will live with us.{@Char quotedblright}
 Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {24}}} all who went in and out of the gate of his city agreed with Hamor and Shechem. And every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.

 The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {27}}} other sons of Jacob came on the slain, and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.
 They {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {28}}} took their flocks and their herds and their donkeys and all that which was in the city and all that which was in the field.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {29}}} all their wealth, and all their children and their wives, they took captive, and made all that was in the houses their prey.

 Jacob {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {14}}} set up at the place where God had spoken with him, a pillar of stone, and poured a drink-offering and oil on it.
 Jacob {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {15}}} called the name of the place where God spoke with him, Bethel.

 And, {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {18}}} as her life was departing (for she was dying),  she called his name Ben-oni; but his father called him Benjamin.

{@S {Jacob {@OuterNote { 10.5p @Font {@B 37}}} made his home in the land of Canaan,}}  where his father had lived as a resident foreigner.
 Joseph {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {2}}} at the age of seventeen was a shepherd with his brothers,  the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father's slave wives. He brought a bad report about them to their father.
 Now {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {3}}} Jacob loved his son Joseph, who was born in his old age; and he made him a long robe with sleeves.
 When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {4}}} his brothers saw that their father loved Joseph more than all his other sons, they hated him and could not speak to him in a friendly manner.
 

@PP
Joseph {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {5}}} also had a dream and told it to his brothers, and they hated him still more.
 This {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {6}}} is what he said to them, {@Char quotedblleft}Hear, if you will, this dream which I have had;
 for {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {7}}} as we were binding sheaves in the field, my sheaf rose up and remained standing, while your sheaves came around and bowed down to my sheaf.{@Char quotedblright}
 His {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {8}}} brothers said to him, {@Char quotedblleft}Do you think you will be king over us? And rule us?{@Char quotedblright} So they hated him still more because of his dreams and his words.
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {9}}} he had another dream and told it to his brothers, saying, {@Char quotedblleft}I have had another dream, and it seemed to me that the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me.{@Char quotedblright}
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {10}}} when he told it to his father and his brothers, his father reproved him and said, {@Char quotedblleft}What is this dream that you have dreamed? Am I and your mother and your brothers supposed to bow down to the earth before you?{@Char quotedblright}
 Therefore {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {11}}} his brothers envied him; but his father kept the matter in mind.
 

@PP
When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {12}}} his brothers went to pasture his father's flocks in Shechem,
 Israel {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {13}}} said to Joseph, {@Char quotedblleft}Are not your brothers pasturing the flocks in Shechem? Come now, I will send you to them.{@Char quotedblright} Joseph replied, {@Char quotedblleft}I am ready.{@Char quotedblright}
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {14}}} his father said to him, {@Char quotedblleft}Go, see whether all goes well with your brothers and with the flock, and bring me back word.{@Char quotedblright} So he sent him out from the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
 There {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {15}}} a  man found him, as he was wandering in the field, and the man asked him, {@Char quotedblleft}What are you seeking?{@Char quotedblright}
 He {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {16}}} said, {@Char quotedblleft}I am looking for my brothers; tell me, please, where they are pasturing the flock.{@Char quotedblright}
 The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {17}}} man said, {@Char quotedblleft}They have gone away, for I heard them say, {@Char quoteleft}Let us go to Dothan.{@Char quoteright}{@Char quotedblright} So Joseph went after his brothers and found them in Dothan.
 

@PP
When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {18}}} they saw him in the distance, before he came to them, they conspired against him to kill him.
 They {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {19}}} said one to another, {@Char quotedblleft}See, here comes that master-dreamer.
 Come {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {20}}} on, let us kill him, and throw him into one of the pits, and then we will say, {@Char quoteleft}A fierce beast has devoured him{@Char quoteright}; and we shall see what will become of his dreams!{@Char quotedblright}
 Rueben, {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {21}}} however, when he heard it, saved him from their hands by saying, {@Char quotedblleft}Let us not take his life.{@Char quotedblright}
 Reuben {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {22}}} also said to them, {@Char quotedblleft}Do not shed blood; throw him into this pit, that is in the wilderness; but do not harm him,{@Char quotedblright} He planned to save him from their hands in order to restore him to his father.
 Nevertheless, {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {23}}} when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his long robe, the robe with sleeves;
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {24}}} they took him and threw him into the pit. But the pit was empty, there being no water in it.
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {25}}} they sat down to eat bread, and when they looked up they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead, and their camels were loaded with spices, balm and myrrh on their way to carry it down to Egypt.
 Judah {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {26}}} said to his brothers, {@Char quotedblleft}What do we gain if we kill our brother and conceal his blood?
 Come, {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {27}}} let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let us do him no violence, for he is our brother, our own flesh and blood.{@Char quotedblright} So his brothers listened to him;
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {28}}} when the Midianite merchants passed by, pulled Joseph up from the pit and sold him for twenty pieces of silver to the Ishmaelites, who brought him to Egypt.
 

@PP
When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {29}}} Reuben returned to the pit and found Joseph gone, he tore his clothes in sorrow.
 He {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {30}}} went back to his brothers and said, {@Char quotedblleft}The boy is gone! What am I going to do?{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {31}}} his brothers took Joseph's robe, killed a he-goat, dipped the long-sleeved robe in the blood,
 tore {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {32}}} it and sent it to their father, saying, {@Char quotedblleft}We found this; see whether it is your son's robe or not.{@Char quotedblright}
 He {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {33}}} recognized it and said, {@Char quotedblleft}It is my son's robe! A wild beast has devoured him! Joseph without doubt is torn in pieces.{@Char quotedblright}
 Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {34}}} Jacob tore his clothes, put sackcloth about his waist, and mourned for his son many days.
 All {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {35}}} his sons and his daughters tried to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted, saying, {@Char quotedblleft}I shall go down to the grave mourning for my son.{@Char quotedblright} So Joseph's father wept for him.
 

@PP
Meanwhile, {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {36}}} the Midianites had sold Joseph in Egypt to one of Pharaoh's court officials, Potiphar, the captain of the guard.

@LP
{@S {About {@OuterNote { 10.5p @Font {@B 38}}} that time Judah left his kinsmen,}}  and settled near a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {2}}} Judah saw there a daughter of a Canaanite whose name was Shua, and he married her. He lay with her,
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {3}}} she conceived, and bore a son, and he named him Er.
 Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {4}}} she conceived again, and bore a son and named him Onan.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {5}}} she bore still another son, and named him Shelah: and it was at Chezib that she bore him.
 

@PP
Now {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {6}}} Judah found a wife for Er his eldest son, and her name was Tamar.
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {7}}} Er, Judah's eldest son, was wicked in the sight of the 
 {@S {Lord }}, and the  {@S { Lord }} took his life. Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {8}}} Judah said to Onan, {@Char quotedblleft}Go and lie with your brother's wife, and perform the duty of a husband's brother to her, and raise up offspring for your brother.{@Char quotedblright}
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {9}}} Onan knew that the child would not be his; so whenever he lay with his brother's wife, he spilled his semen on the ground, in order not to raise up offspring for his brother.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {10}}} what he did was evil in the sight of the 
 {@S {Lord }} : therefore he took his life also. 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {11}}} said Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law, {@Char quotedblleft}Remain a widow in your father's house, until Shelah my son is grown up{@Char quotedblright}; for he said to himself, {@Char quotedblleft}I will not let him marry  her, he must not die like his brothers.{@Char quotedblright} So Tamar went and lived in her father's house.
 

@PP
After {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {12}}} many days had passed, Shua's daughter, the wife of Judah, died. And when Judah had finished mourning, he went up to see about his sheep-shearers at Timnah, with his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
 Someone {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {13}}} told Tamar, saying, {@Char quotedblleft}Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.{@Char quotedblright}
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {14}}} she took off the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself with her veil. She sat, veiled, in the gate of Enaim, which is by the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah had grown up without her being given to him as wife.
 When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {15}}} Judah saw her, he thought her to be a prostitute; because she had veiled her face.
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {16}}} he turned aside to her by the roadside, and said, {@Char quotedblleft}Permit me, I pray you, to lie with you.{@Char quotedblright} For he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, {@Char quotedblleft}What will you give me to lie with me?{@Char quotedblright}
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {17}}} he said, {@Char quotedblleft}I will send you a young goat from the flock.{@Char quotedblright} And she said, {@Char quotedblleft}Will you give me a pledge, until you send it?{@Char quotedblright}
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {18}}} he said, {@Char quotedblleft}What pledge should I give you?{@Char quotedblright} And she said, {@Char quotedblleft}Your seal-ring and your chain and your staff that is in your hand.{@Char quotedblright} So he gave them to her, and lay with her, and she became pregnant.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {19}}} she got up, and went away, and took off her veil, and put on the garments of her widowhood.
 

@PP
Now {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {20}}} when Judah sent the young goat by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman's hand, he could not find her.
 He {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {21}}} asked the men of her place, saying, {@Char quotedblleft}Where is the sacred prostitute, who was at Enaim by the wayside?{@Char quotedblright} And they said, {@Char quotedblleft}There has been no sacred prostitute here.{@Char quotedblright}
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {22}}} he returned to Judah, and said, {@Char quotedblleft}I have not found her; and  the men of the place said, {@Char quoteleft}There has been no sacred prostitute here.{@Char quoteright}{@Char quotedblright}
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {23}}} Judah said, {@Char quotedblleft}Let her keep the pledge, otherwise we will be put to shame.  I have sent this goat, and you have not found her.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
Now {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {24}}} after about three months, Judah was told, {@Char quotedblleft}Tamar your daughter-in-law has been acting like a whore and is pregnant.{@Char quotedblright} And Judah said, {@Char quotedblleft}Bring her forth and let her be burnt.{@Char quotedblright}
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {25}}} when she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, {@Char quotedblleft}By the man to whom these things belong, I am with child.{@Char quotedblright} She also said, {@Char quotedblleft}Look at them and see if you know whose these are, the seal-ring and the chain and the staff.{@Char quotedblright}
 When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {26}}} Judah recognized them, he said, {@Char quotedblleft}She is more in the right than I, because I did not give her to Shelah my son.{@Char quotedblright} But he did not lie with her again.
 

@PP
When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {27}}} her time came to give birth, it was found that twins were in her womb.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {28}}} while she was in labor, one put out a hand and the midwife took and bound on his hand a bright red thread, saying, {@Char quotedblleft}This one came out first.{@Char quotedblright}
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {29}}}  he drew back his hand, and his brother came out, and she said, {@Char quotedblleft}What a breach you have made for yourself!{@Char quotedblright} Therefore he was named Perez.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {30}}} afterward his brother came out, who had the bright red thread on his hand; therefore he was named Zerah.

{@S {Joseph {@OuterNote { 10.5p @Font {@B 39}}} was taken down to Egypt,}}  and Potiphar, one of Pharaoh's officers, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him there.
 

@PP
Now {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {2}}} the  {@S {Lord }} was with Joseph, so that he prospered; and he remained in the house of his master the Egyptian.
 When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {3}}} his master saw that the  {@S {Lord

 From {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {5}}} the time that he made him overseer in his house and over all that he had, the 
 {@S {Lord }} blessed the Egyptian's household for Joseph's sake, and the blessing of the 
 {@S {Lord }} was upon all that he had in the house and in the field. 
Leaving {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {6}}} all that he had in Joseph's charge, he knew nothing about his affairs except about the food which he ate. Also Joseph was handsome and attractive.
 

@PP
After {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {7}}} these honors had come to Joseph, his master's wife directed her glances toward him and tried to tempt him.
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {8}}} he refused, saying to her, {@Char quotedblleft}See, my master knows nothing about what I do in the house, and he has put all that he has in my charge.
 No {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {9}}} one has greater authority in this house than I, and he has kept back nothing from me but you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wrong and sin against God?{@Char quotedblright}
 Day {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {10}}} after day she tempted Joseph, but he did not listen to her nor accept her advances.
 One {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {11}}} day, however, when he went into the house to do his work and when none of the men of the household were at home,
 she {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {12}}} caught hold of his garment and tried to seduce him; but he left his garment in her hand and fled out of the house.
 

@PP
When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {13}}} she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled,
 she {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {14}}} called to her household servants and said to them,
 {@Char quotedblleft}See, the master has brought a Hebrew in to insult us. He came to me to rape me, and I screamed loudly;
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {15}}} when he heard me scream, he left his garment with me and ran out of the house.{@Char quotedblright}
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {16}}} she kept his garment by her until his master came home;
 then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {17}}} she told him the same story, saying, {@Char quotedblleft}The Hebrew slave whom you have brought to us came to me to insult me;
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {18}}} when I screamed he left his garment with me and fled.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {19}}} Joseph's master heard the statements which his wife made to him, his anger was aroused;

{@S {Some {@OuterNote { 10.5p @Font {@B 40}}} time after these things the cupbearer of the king of Egypt}} and his baker offended their master the king of Egypt,
 so {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {2}}} that Pharaoh was angry with these two officers and imprisoned them in the house of the captain of the guard, in the same prison where Joseph was confined.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {3}}} the captain of the guard assigned Joseph to them, and he waited on them;
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {4}}} they remained in confinement for some time.
 

@PP
Meanwhile {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {5}}} the king of Egypt's cupbearer and baker, who were confined in the prison, both had dreams the same night, each with a paticular meaning.
 When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {6}}} Joseph came in to them in the morning, he saw plainly that they were sad.
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {7}}} he asked Pharaoh's officers, {@Char quotedblleft}Why do you look so sad today?{@Char quotedblright}
 They {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {8}}} answered. {@Char quotedblleft}We have had a dream and there is no one who can interpret it.{@Char quotedblright} Then Joseph said to them, {@Char quotedblleft}Do not the interpretations of dreams belong to God? Tell them to me.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {9}}} the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph and said to him, {@Char quotedblleft}In my dream I saw a vine before me,
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {10}}} on the vine were three branches, and as if budding it put out blossoms and its clusters brought forth ripe grapes.
 Pharaoh's {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {11}}} cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and pressed them into his cup and gave the cup to Pharaoh.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {12}}} Joseph said to him, {@Char quotedblleft}This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days;
 within {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {13}}} three days Pharaoh will release you from prison and restore you to your office, and you will give Pharaoh's cup into his hand as you used to do when you were his cupbearer.
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {14}}} when all goes well with you, remember me, show kindness to me and speak in my behalf to Pharaoh and bring me out of this house;
 for {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {15}}} I was unjustly stolen from the land of the Hebrews, and here also I have done nothing that they should put me in the dungeon.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {16}}} the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable, he said to Joseph, {@Char quotedblleft}I also saw something in my dream: there were three baskets of white bread on my head,
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {17}}} in the uppermost basket there were all kinds of baked food for Pharaoh, and the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.{@Char quotedblright}
 Joseph {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {18}}} answered, {@Char quotedblleft}This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days;
 within {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {19}}} three days Pharaoh will take off your head and hang you on a tree, and the birds shall eat your flesh.{@Char quotedblright}

Now {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {20}}} on the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, he made a feast for all his officials. Then he released the chief cupbearer and the chief baker.

Two {@OuterNote { 10.5p @Font {@B 41}}} years later Pharaoh had a dream: as he stood by the Nile,
 he {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {2}}} saw coming up from the Nile seven cows, good-looking and fat, and they had been feeding in the river grass.
 Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {3}}} seven other cows came up after them out of the Nile, bad-looking and lean, and they stood by the other cows on the bank of the Nile.
 The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {4}}} bad-looking cows ate up the seven good-looking, fat cows. Then Pharaoh awoke.
 

@PP
Afterward {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {5}}} he slept and had a second dream and saw seven ears, plump and good, growing up on one stalk.
 Also {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {6}}} seven ears, thin and blasted by the east wind, sprang up after them.
 The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {7}}} thin ears swallowed up the seven plump, full ears. Then Pharaoh awoke, and realized that it was a dream.
 

@PP
In {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {8}}} the morning Pharaoh's mind was disturbed; so he sent and called all the magicians and wise men of Egypt and told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them to him.
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {9}}} the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, {@Char quotedblleft}I now must remind you of my offenses:
 Pharaoh {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {10}}} was very angry with his servants and imprisoned me and the chief baker in the house of the captain of the guard.
 We {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {11}}} both had dreams the same night, each with a special meaning.
 There {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {12}}} was also with us a young Hebrew, a slave of the captain of the guard; and we told him and he interpreted our dreams to us, to each of us according to his dream.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {13}}} our dreams came true exactly as he interpreted them to us: I was restored to my office, but the other man was hanged.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {14}}} Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon; and he shaved his face and changed his clothes and came to Pharaoh.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {15}}} Pharaoh said to Joseph, {@Char quotedblleft}I have had a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. Now I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.{@Char quotedblright}
 Joseph {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {16}}} answered Pharaoh, {@Char quotedblleft}Not I; God only can give Pharaoh a satisfactory answer.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {17}}} Pharaoh said to Joseph, {@Char quotedblleft}In my dream as I stood on the bank of the Nile,
 I {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {18}}} saw seven cows, fat and good-looking, which had been feeding in the river grass.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {19}}} there came up after them seven more cows, thin, and bad-looking and lean, worse than I ever saw in all the land of Egypt;
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {20}}} the lean and bad-looking cows ate up the first seven fat cows;
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {21}}} when they had eaten them up, one could not tell that they had eaten them, for they were still as bad-looking as at the beginning. Then I awoke.
 Again {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {22}}} I dreamed and saw seven ears, plump and good, grow up on one stalk;
 then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {23}}} seven ears, withered, thin, blasted with the east wind, sprang up after them;
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {24}}} the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears. I have told the dream to the magicians, but there is no one who can interpret it to me.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {25}}} Joseph said to Pharaoh, {@Char quotedblleft}Pharaoh's two dreams signify the same thing; God has made known to Pharaoh what he is about to do.
 The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {26}}} seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years. It is one dream.
 The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {27}}} seven lean and ugly cows that came up after them are also seven years, and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind represent seven years of famine.
 That {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {28}}} is why I said to Pharaoh, {@Char quoteleft}God has shown to Pharaoh what he is about to do.{@Char quoteright}
 Seven {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {29}}} years of great plenty throughout the land of Egypt are coming,
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {30}}} they will be followed by seven years of famine, so that all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The famine will consume all that the land produces;
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {31}}} plenty will not be known in the land because of that famine which follows, for it will be very severe.
 

@PP
{@Char quotedblleft}The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {32}}} dream came twice to Pharaoh to indicate that its fulfilment is assured and that God will soon make it come true.
 Now {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {33}}} therefore let Pharaoh select a man who is discreet and wise and place him in control of the land of Egypt.
 Pharaoh {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {34}}} should take action and appoint overseers over the land and collect one-fifth of all the produce of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.
 Let {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {35}}} them gather all the food of these good years that come and store the grain under the authority of Pharaoh, and let them hold it for food in the cities.
 The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {36}}} food will furnish a supply for the land during the seven years of famine which will be in the land of Egypt, so that the people of the land will not perish because of the famine.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {37}}} plan pleased Pharaoh and all his officials;
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {38}}} Pharaoh said to his officials, {@Char quotedblleft}Can we find one like this, a man in whom is the spirit of God?{@Char quotedblright}
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {39}}} Pharaoh said to Joseph, {@Char quotedblleft}Since God has shown you all this, there is no one so discreet and wise as you.
 You {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {40}}} will be at the head of my dominion, and all my people shall be ruled as you command, only on the throne I will be superior to you.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {41}}} Pharaoh said to Joseph, {@Char quotedblleft}See, I have appointed you over all the land of Egypt.{@Char quotedblright}
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {42}}} Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his finger and put it upon Joseph's finger and clothed him in garments of fine linen and put a golden collar about his neck.
 He {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {43}}} also made him ride in the second-best chariot which he had; and they cried before him, {@Char quotedblleft}Attention!{@Char quotedblright} So he placed him over all the land of Egypt.
 

@PP
Pharaoh {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {44}}} also said to Joseph, {@Char quotedblleft}I am Pharaoh, but without your consent no one may lift up hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.{@Char quotedblright}
 Pharaoh {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {45}}} named Joseph Zaphenath-paneah and gave him as a wife Asenath the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On. Josephs's authority was over all Egypt,

@PP
In {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {47}}} the seven plenteous years there were bountiful harvests,
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {48}}} Joseph gathered up all the food of the seven plenteous years, which were in the land of Egypt, and stored the food in the cities, putting in each city the products of the fields about it.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {49}}} Joseph stored up grain as the sand of the sea, in great quantities, until he ceased to keep account, because it could not be measured.
 

@PP
Two {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {50}}} sons were born to Joseph and Asenath before the year of famine came.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {51}}} Joseph named the eldest Manasseh; for he said, {@Char quotedblleft}God has made me forget all my toil and all my father's household.{@Char quotedblright}
 He {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {52}}} named the second son Ephraim; for he said, {@Char quotedblleft}God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {53}}} the seven years of plenty which had been in the land of Egypt were over,
 the {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {54}}} seven years of famine began, as Joseph had said; and there was famine in all lands, but throughout the land of Egypt there was food,
 for {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {55}}} when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread, and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, {@Char quotedblleft}Go to Joseph and do what he tells you.{@Char quotedblright}
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {56}}} when the famine was universal throughout the earth, Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold food to the Egyptians: but the famine was severe in the land of Egypt.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {57}}} the peoples of all lands came to Joseph in Egypt to buy grain, for the famine was severe throughout the world.

@LP
{@S {Jacob {@OuterNote { 10.5p @Font {@B 42}}} learned that there was grain for sale in Egypt,}}  and he said to his sons, {@Char quotedblleft}Why do you stand looking at each other?
 I {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {2}}} have heard that there is grain for sale in Egypt; go down there and buy for us, so that we may live and not die.{@Char quotedblright}
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {3}}} Joseph's ten brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {4}}} Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph's own brother, with his brothers; for he feared that some harm might come to him.
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {5}}} the sons of Jacob went among others to buy grain, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
 

@PP
Now {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {6}}} Joseph was the governor over the land; it was he who sold to all the people of the land. Therefore Joseph's brothers came and bowed before him with their faces to the earth.
 When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {7}}} Joseph saw his brothers he knew them, but he acted as a stranger toward them and spoke harshly to them and said, {@Char quotedblleft}Where do you come from?{@Char quotedblright} They said, {@Char quotedblleft}From the land of Canaan to buy food.{@Char quotedblright}
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {8}}} Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not know him.
 

@PP
Joseph {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {9}}} also remembered the dreams which he had dreamed about them and said to them, {@Char quotedblleft}You spies! You have come to find out the weaknesses of the land.{@Char quotedblright}
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {10}}} they said to him, {@Char quotedblleft}No my lord; your servants have come to buy food.
 We {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {11}}} are all sons of one man; we are honest men; your servants are not spies.{@Char quotedblright}
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {12}}} he said to them, {@Char quotedblleft}No, you have come to see the weaknesses of the land.{@Char quotedblright}
 They {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {13}}} replied, {@Char quotedblleft}We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; the youngest is today with our father, and one is no more.{@Char quotedblright}
 Joseph {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {14}}} said to them, {@Char quotedblleft}It is just as I said to you, you are spies.
 By {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {15}}} this you shall be tested: as sure as Pharaoh lives you shall not go away unless your youngest brother comes here.
 Send {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {16}}} one of you, and let him bring your brother, while you remain in prison, that it may be proved whether you are telling the truth or not. Or else, as sure as Pharaoh lives, you are indeed spies.{@Char quotedblright}
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {17}}} he put them all into prison for three days.
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {18}}} Joseph said to them on the third day, {@Char quotedblleft}Do this, and live, for I fear God:
 if {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {19}}} you are honest men, let one of your brothers remain in prison, but you go, carry grain to supply the needs of your households
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {20}}} bring your youngest brother to me. So shall your words be verified, and you shall not die.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
They {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {21}}} did as Joseph commanded, but they said to one another, {@Char quotedblleft}We are indeed guilty because of the way we treated our brother, for when we saw his distress and when he pleaded with us, we would not listen; therefore this trouble has come upon us.{@Char quotedblright}
 Reuben {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {22}}} added, {@Char quotedblleft}Did I not say to you, {@Char quoteleft}Do not sin against the boy,{@Char quoteright} but you would not listen? Therefore now his very blood is required.{@Char quotedblright}
 They {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {23}}} did not know, however, that Joseph understood them, for he had spoken to them through an interpreter.
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {24}}} he turned away from them and wept; then he turned back and spoke to them, and, taking Simeon from among them, bound him before their eyes.
 Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {25}}} Joseph gave orders to fill their vessels with grain and to restore each man's money to his sack and to give them provision for the journey; and  it was done to them.
 

@PP
So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {26}}} they loaded their donkeys with their grain, and departed.
 When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {27}}} they stopped for the night, one of them opened his sack to get feed for his donkey, and he saw the silver at the top of the sack.
 He {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {28}}} said to his brothers, {@Char quotedblleft}My silver has been returned; here it is in my pack.{@Char quotedblright} They were dismayed and fearful, and said to one another, {@Char quotedblleft}What has God done to us?{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {29}}} they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened, saying,
 {@Char quotedblleft}The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {30}}} man who is master in that land spoke harshly to us and imprisoned us as spies.
 We {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {31}}} said to him, {@Char quoteleft}We are honest men; we are not spies;
 we {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {32}}} are twelve brothers, sons of the same father; one is no longer living, and the youngest is today with our father in the land of Canaan.{@Char quoteright}
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {33}}} the man who is master in that land said to us, {@Char quoteleft}This is how I will discover if you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me and take the grain to supply the needs of your households and depart.
 Bring {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {34}}} your youngest brother to me; then I will know that you are not spies, but that you are honest men; and I will restore your brother to you and you shall be free to go about in the land.{@Char quoteright}{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
As {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {35}}} they were emptying their sacks, they found that each man's purse of money was in his sack; and when they and their father saw their purses filled with money, they were afraid.
 Jacob {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {36}}} their father said to them, {@Char quotedblleft}You have robbed me of my children: Joseph is no longer living and Simeon is no longer here, and you would take Benjamin also. All this misfortune has overtaken me!{@Char quotedblright}
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {37}}} Reuben said to his father, {@Char quotedblleft}You may put my two sons to death, if I do not return him to you. Put him in my charge and I will bring him back to you.{@Char quotedblright}
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {38}}} Jacob said, {@Char quotedblleft}My son must not go down with you, for his brother is dead and he only is left. If harm should come to him on the way by which you go, then you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
The {@OuterNote { 10.5p @Font {@B 43}}} famine was severe in the land;
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {2}}} when Joseph's brothers had eaten all the grain which they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, {@Char quotedblleft}Go again, and buy us some more grain.{@Char quotedblright}
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {3}}} Judah replied, {@Char quotedblleft}The man warned us: {@Char quoteleft}You will not be able to see me unless your brother is with you.{@Char quoteright}
 If {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {4}}} you will let our brother go with us, we will go down and buy you food,
 but {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {5}}} if you will not let him, we will not go down; for the man said to us, {@Char quoteleft}You will not be able to see me unless your brother is with you.{@Char quoteright}{@Char quotedblright}
 Jacob {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {6}}} said, {@Char quotedblleft}Why did you treat me so badly by telling the man you had another brother?{@Char quotedblright}
 They {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {7}}} replied, {@Char quotedblleft}The man asked particularly about us and our relatives, saying, {@Char quoteleft}Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?{@Char quoteright} So we answered his questions as he asked them. How were we to know that he would say, {@Char quoteleft}Bring your brother down{@Char quoteright}?{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {8}}} Judah said to Israel his father, {@Char quotedblleft}Send the boy with me, and we will go at once, so that both we and you and our little ones may live and not die.
 I {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {9}}} will be surety for him, you can hold me responsible for him. If I do not bring him to you and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever;
 for {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {10}}} if we had not lingered, surely we would now have returned the second time.{@Char quotedblright}
 Therefore {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {11}}} their father said to them, {@Char quotedblleft}If it must be so, then do this: take some of the products of the land in your jars and carry down a present to the man, a little balm, a little honey, spices, myrrh, pistachio nuts, and almonds.
 Take {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {12}}} twice as much money with you, carrying back the money that was returned in your sacks; perhaps there was a mistake.
 Take {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {13}}} also your brother and go again to the man,
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {14}}} may God Almighty grant that the man may be merciful to you and release Benjamin and your other brother. But if I am robbed of my sons, I am bereaved indeed!{@Char quotedblright}
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {15}}} the men took the present and twice as much money and Benjamin, and went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph.
 

@PP
When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {16}}} Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, {@Char quotedblleft}Bring the men into the house, kill animals, and prepare the meal, for these men will eat with me at noon.{@Char quotedblright}
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {17}}} he did as Joseph directed, and brought the men into Joseph's house.
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {18}}} the brothers were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house, and they said, {@Char quotedblleft}We are being brought in on account of the money that was returned in our grain-saeks at our first visit, so that he can overpower and arrest us and take us as slaves, together with our donkeys.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {19}}} when they came near to Joseph's steward, they spoke to him at the door of the house
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {20}}} said, {@Char quotedblleft}Oh, my lord, we came down the first time only to buy food;
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {21}}} when we reached home, we opened our sacks and discovered every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in its full weight; and we have brought it back with us.
 We {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {22}}} have also brought down with us other money with which to buy food; we do not know who put our money into our sacks.{@Char quotedblright}
 He {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {23}}} replied, {@Char quotedblleft}Be calm, don't be afraid; your God and the God of your father has given you the treasure in your sacks; I received your full payment.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
Then he brought Simeon out to them. The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {24}}} steward also conducted the men to Joseph's house and gave them water with which to wash their feet, and he gave their donkeys fodder.
 Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {25}}} they made ready the present in anticipation of Joseph's coming at noon, for they had heard that they were to eat there.
 

@PP
When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {26}}} Joseph came into the house, they gave him the present which they had brought and bowed down low before him.
 He {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {27}}} asked them regarding their welfare and said, {@Char quotedblleft}Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still living?{@Char quotedblright}
 They {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {28}}} replied, {@Char quotedblleft}Your servant, our father, is well; he is still alive.{@Char quotedblright} Then they bowed their heads and made obeisance.
 

@PP
When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {29}}} Joseph looked up and saw Benjamin his brother, his own mother's son, he said. {@Char quotedblleft}Is this your youngest brother of whom you spoke to me?{@Char quotedblright} And he added, {@Char quotedblleft}God be gracious to you, my son.{@Char quotedblright}
 Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {30}}} because he was overcome with emotion for his brother he sought a place to weep; and he went into his room and wept there.
 Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {31}}} he bathed his face and came out and controlling himself he said, {@Char quotedblleft}Bring on the food.{@Char quotedblright}
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {32}}} they brought food for him by himself and for them by themselves and for the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians could not eat with the Hebrews, for to do so is abhorrent to the Egyptians.
 Joseph's {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {33}}} brothers were seated before him, the eldest according to his right as the oldest and the youngest according to his youth; and the men looked at each other in astonishment.
 Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {34}}} Joseph had portions served to them from the food before him; but Benjamin's portions were five times as much as any of theirs. So they drank and were merry with him.
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 10.5p @Font {@B 44}}} he gave this command to the steward of his household: {@Char quotedblleft}Fill the men's grain-sacks with food, as much as they can carry,
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {2}}} put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest and the money too that he paid for his grain.{@Char quotedblright} And he did as Joseph commanded.
 

@PP
As {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {3}}} soon as the morning light appeared, the men were sent away, together with their donkeys.
 When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {4}}} they had gone out of the city, but were not yet far away, Joseph commanded his steward, {@Char quotedblleft}Follow after the men; and when you overtake them, say to them, {@Char quoteleft}Why have you returned evil for good?
 Why {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {5}}} have you stolen my silver cup, that from which my master drinks and by which he divines the future? You have done wrong in so doing!{@Char quoteright}{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {6}}} the steward overtook them and said these words to them.
 They {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {7}}} said to him, {@Char quotedblleft}Why does my lord speak such words as this? Far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing!
 Remember {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {8}}} that we brought back to you from the hind of Canaan the money which we found in our sacks. Why then should we steal silver or gold from your master's house?
 If {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {9}}} one of us is found with the goblet then let him die, and we will be my lord's slaves.{@Char quotedblright}
 He {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {10}}} said, {@Char quotedblleft}Let it now be as you have said: he with whom it is found will be my slave; but the rest may go free.{@Char quotedblright}
 Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {11}}} each one hastily took down his sack to the ground and opened it;
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {12}}} the steward searched, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest; and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.
 Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {13}}} they tore their clothes in sorrow, and every man loaded his donkey and returned to the city.
 

@PP
When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {14}}} Judah and his brothers came back to Joseph's house, he was still there; and they threw themselves before him on the ground.
 Joseph {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {15}}} said to them, {@Char quotedblleft}What deed is this that you have done? Do you not know that a man like me can divine secrets?{@Char quotedblright}
 Judah {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {16}}} replied, {@Char quotedblleft}What can we say, my lord? What can we plead or how can we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants. See, both we and he also in whose possession the cup was found are my lord's slaves.{@Char quotedblright}
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {17}}} Joseph said, {@Char quotedblleft}Far be it from me that I should do such a thing! The man in whose possession the cup was found must be my slave; but you yourselves go up in peace to your father.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {18}}} Judah came close to him and said, {@Char quotedblleft}My lord, let your servant, I beg of you, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not your anger be kindled against your servant; for you are as great as Pharaoh.
 My {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {19}}} lord, you asked us, {@Char quoteleft}Have you a father or a brother?{@Char quoteright}
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {20}}} we said to you, {@Char quoteleft}We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one. Since his brother is dead, he is the only son of his mother who is left; and his father loves him.{@Char quoteright}
 You {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {21}}} said to us, {@Char quoteleft}Bring him down to me, so that I can see him.{@Char quoteright}
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {22}}} we said to you, my lord, {@Char quoteleft}The boy cannot leave his father. If he should leave his father, his father would die.{@Char quoteright}
 Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {23}}} you said to us, {@Char quoteleft}Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will not be able to see me again.{@Char quoteright}
 When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {24}}} we went up to your servant, my father, we told him your words, my lord;
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {25}}} our father said, {@Char quoteleft}Go again, buy us a little food.{@Char quoteright}
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {26}}} we said, {@Char quoteleft}We cannot go down. If our youngest brother is with us, then we will go; for we cannot see the man unless our youngest brother is with us.{@Char quoteright}
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {27}}} your servant, my father, said to us, {@Char quoteleft}You know that my wife bore me two sons;
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {28}}} one went missing, and I said that surely he was torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since.
 If {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {29}}} you take this one also from me, and harm befall him, you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.{@Char quoteright}
 Now {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {30}}} if I return to your servant, my father, and the boy with whose life his heart is bound up is not with us,
 then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {31}}} when he sees that there is no boy, he will die, and we, your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to the grave.
 Indeed, {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {32}}} my lord, I personally became surety for the boy to my father, when I said, {@Char quoteleft}If I do not bring him to you, then I will bear the blame in my father's eyes forever.{@Char quoteright}
 Now {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {33}}} therefore let me, I beg of you, remain instead of the boy as your slave, my lord, but let the boy go up with his brothers.
 For {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {34}}} how can I go up to my father, if the boy is not with me, and see the pain and sorrow that would come upon my father.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 10.5p @Font {@B 45}}} Joseph could not control himself before all those who were standing by him; so he cried out, {@Char quotedblleft}Let everyone leave me.{@Char quotedblright} So nobody stood with him while Joseph made himself known to his brothers.
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {2}}} he wept so loudly that the Egyptians and Pharaoh's court heard.
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {3}}} Joseph said to his brothers, {@Char quotedblleft}I am Joseph. Is my father still alive?{@Char quotedblright} But his brothers could not answer him for they were frightened in his presence.
 Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {4}}} Joseph said to his brothers, {@Char quotedblleft}Come near to me, I beg of you.{@Char quotedblright} So they came near. And he said, {@Char quotedblleft}I am Joseph your brother whom you sold into Egypt.
 Do {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {5}}} not be troubled nor angry with yourselves that you sold me here, for God sent me before you to preserve life.
 For {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {6}}} the famine has already been two years in the land, and there are still five years in which there will be neither ploughing nor harvest.
 God {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {7}}} sent me before you to keep you alive through a great deliverance and  give you descendants on the earth.
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {8}}} now it clear that it was not you who sent me here, but God. And he has made me like a father to Pharaoh and master of all his household and ruler over all the land of Egypt.
 

@PP
{@Char quotedblleft}Go {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {9}}} up quickly to my father and say to him, {@Char quoteleft}Your son Joseph says: God has made me master of all Egypt, come down to me without delay.
 You {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {10}}} will live in the land of Goshen, and you will be near me with your children and children's children, with your flocks and your herds and all that you have,
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {11}}} there I will provide for you. Otherwise you, together with your household and all that you have, will starve; for there will be five more years of famine.{@Char quoteright}
 Now {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {12}}} you and my brother Benjamin see that it is really me, Joseph, who is speaking to you.
 Tell {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {13}}} my father all about my honor in Egypt and what you have seen, and you must quickly bring him down here.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {14}}} he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck and wept, and Benjamin wept upon his neck.
 He {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {15}}} also kissed all his brothers and wept with them; and after that his brothers talked with him.
 

@PP
The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {16}}} report that Joseph's brothers had arrived spread in Pharaoh's palace, and it pleased Pharaoh and his servants greatly.
 Pharaoh {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {17}}} said to Joseph, {@Char quotedblleft}Say to your brothers, {@Char quoteleft}Do this: load your beasts, go to the land of Canaan,
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {18}}} take your father and your households and come to me, and I will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you shall eat the best that the land affords.
 Now {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {19}}} you are commanded to do this: take wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives and bring your father and come.
 Also {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {20}}} pay no attention to your household goods, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.{@Char quoteright}{@Char quotedblright}
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {21}}} the sons of Jacob did as commanded.
 

@PP
So Joseph gave them wagons according to Pharaoh's orders and provisions for the journey.
 To {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {22}}} each of them he gave a change of clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothing.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {23}}} to his father he sent the following gifts: ten donkeys loaded with the best products of Egypt and ten donkeys loaded with grain and bread and provisions for his father on the journey.
 

@PP
So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {24}}} he sent his brothers away, and as they departed, he said to them, {@Char quotedblleft}See that you do not quarrel on the journey!{@Char quotedblright}
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {25}}} they went up out of Egypt and came into the land of Canaan to Jacob their father.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {26}}} they told him, {@Char quotedblleft}Joseph is yet alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt!{@Char quotedblright} Then Jacob's heart stood still, for he could not believe them.
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {27}}} when they told him all that Joseph had said to them and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived,
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {28}}} he, Israel, said, {@Char quotedblleft}It is enough; Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.{@Char quotedblright}

{@S {Jacob {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {28}}}  sent Judah before him to Joseph,}}  so that he might show him the way to Goshen.
 When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {29}}} they came into the land of Goshen, Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to Goshen to meet Jacob his father, and when he presented himself to him Jacob fell on his neck and wept there a long time.
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {30}}} Jacob said to Joseph, {@Char quotedblleft}Now let me die, since I have seen your face and know that you are still alive.{@Char quotedblright}
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {31}}} Joseph said to his brothers and to his father's household, {@Char quotedblleft}I will go up and tell Pharaoh and will say to him, {@Char quoteleft}My brothers and my father's household who were in the land of Canaan have come to me.
 Now {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {32}}} the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of cattle; and they have brought their flocks and cattle and all that they have.{@Char quoteright}
 When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {33}}} Pharaoh calls you and asks, {@Char quoteleft}What is your occupation?{@Char quoteright}
 you {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {34}}} must say, {@Char quoteleft}We, your servants have been keepers of cattle all our lives, both we and our fathers,{@Char quoteright} so that you might be alloed to live in the province of Goshen, for shepherds are looked down upon by the Egyptians.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 10.5p @Font {@B 47}}} Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, {@Char quotedblleft}My father and my brothers with their sheep and cattle and all that they possess have come from the land of Canaan; and now they are in the province of Goshen.{@Char quotedblright}
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {2}}} he took five of his brothers and presented them to Pharaoh.
 Pharaoh {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {3}}} said to them, {@Char quotedblleft}What is your occupation?{@Char quotedblright} And they said to Pharaoh, {@Char quotedblleft}We are shepherds, both we and our fathers.{@Char quotedblright}
 They {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {4}}} also said to Pharaoh, {@Char quotedblleft}We have come to live in the land, because there is no pasture for our flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. We beg of you, to let us stay in the province of Goshen.{@Char quotedblright}
 Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {5}}} Pharaoh said to Joseph, {@Char quotedblleft}Since your father and your brothers have come to you,
 the {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {6}}} land of Egypt is at your disposal. Settle them in the best part of it. Let them stay in the province of Goshen; and if you know any capable men among them, put them in charge of my cattle.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
Joseph {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {7}}} also brought in Jacob his father and presented him to Pharaoh; and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
 Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {8}}} Pharaoh said to Jacob, {@Char quotedblleft}How many years have you lived?{@Char quotedblright}
 Jacob {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {9}}} answered, {@Char quotedblleft}I have lived a hundred and thirty years; few and hard have been the years of my life, and they have not been as many as those that my ancestors lived on earth.{@Char quotedblright}
 After {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {10}}} Jacob had blessed Pharaoh, he went out from Pharaoh's presence.
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {11}}} Joseph gave his father and his brothers a place to live in and a home in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, near Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
 

@PP
Joseph {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {12}}} also provided food for his father and his brothers and all his father's household according to the number of their little children.
 

@PP
And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {13}}} there was no bread in all the land; since the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished because of the famine.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {14}}} Joseph gathered in all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they
 bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house. 

@PP
And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {15}}} when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, {@Char quotedblleft}Give us bread: for why should we die before your eyes because our money fails?{@Char quotedblright}
 Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {16}}} Joseph said, {@Char quotedblleft}Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money has failed.{@Char quotedblright}
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {17}}} they brought their cattle to Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, the flocks of sheep, and herds of cattle, and the donkeys. That year he sustained them with bread in exchange for all their cattle.
 

@PP
And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {18}}} when that year was ended, they came to him the second year, and said to him, {@Char quotedblleft}We will not hide from you, my lord, now that our money is all spent; and the herds of cattle are yours; there is nothing left in the your sight, but our bodies and our lands.
 Why {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {19}}} should we perish before your eyes, both we and our land? Take possession of us and our land in return for bread, and we and our land will become personal possessions of Pharaoh; and give us seed, so that we will live, and not die, so that the land does not become desolate.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {20}}} Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; because every Egytpian sold his field, because the famine was severe upon them. So the land became Pharaoh's.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {21}}} as for the people, he reduced them to slavery from one end of Egypt  to the other.
 Only {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {22}}} the land of the priests he did not buy, because the priests had a definte allowance from Pharaoh, and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them. Hence they did not sell their land.
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {23}}} Joseph said to the people, {@Char quotedblleft}I have bought you and you land today for Pharaoh. Here is seed for you, and you must sow the land.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {24}}} at the ingatherings, you must give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts will be your own, for seed
 for the field, and for your food, and for those of your households, and for food for your little ones.{@Char quotedblright}
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {25}}} they said, {@Char quotedblleft}You have saved our lives; let us find favor in your sight, lord, and we will be Pharaoh's slaves.{@Char quotedblright}
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {26}}} Joseph made it a law, still in force today, that Pharaoh should have a fifth; only the land of the priests did not come into the possession of Pharaoh.
 

@PP
And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {27}}} the Israelites lived in Egypt, in the land of Goshen, and they acquired possessions in it and had many children and became exceedingly numerous.
 Jacob {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {28}}} lived for seventeen years in Egypt and died at the age of one hundred and twenty-seven.

@LP
{@S {When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {29}}} the time drew near for Jacob to die,}}  he called his son Joseph and said to him, {@Char quotedblleft}If now you will do me a favor, put your hand under my thigh and swear that you will act kindly and faithfully with me. Do not bury me, I beg of you, in Egypt;
 but {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {30}}} when I lie down to sleep with my ancestors, carry, me out of Egypt and bury me in their burying-place.{@Char quotedblright} Joseph replied, {@Char quotedblleft}I will  do as you have requested.{@Char quotedblright}
 Jacob {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {31}}} said, {@Char quotedblleft}Give me your oath{@Char quotedblright}; so Joseph gave him his oath; and Israel bowed toward the head of the bed.
 

@PP
Now {@OuterNote { 10.5p @Font {@B 48}}} after these things, Joseph was told, {@Char quotedblleft}Your father is sick.{@Char quotedblright} So he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
 When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {2}}} Jacob was told, {@Char quotedblleft}Your son Joseph has come to you.{@Char quotedblright} Jacob rallied his strength and sat up on the bed.
 Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {3}}} Jacob said to Joseph, {@Char quotedblleft}God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {4}}} said to me, {@Char quoteleft}I will make you fruitful, and numerous, and I will make of you a company of peoples, and will give this land to your descendants after you for an everlasting possession.{@Char quoteright}
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {5}}} now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt will be mine just as Reuben and Simeon are mine.
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {6}}} your offspring, which you father after them, will be yours. Their inheritance will come from their older brothers.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {7}}} as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died to my sorrow in the land of Canaan on the way, some distance from Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {8}}} when Israel saw Joseph's sons, he said, {@Char quotedblleft}Who are these?{@Char quotedblright}
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {9}}} Joseph said to his father, {@Char quotedblleft}They are my sons, whom God has given me here.{@Char quotedblright} And Israel said, Bring them, I pray you, to me, and I will bless them.
 Now {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {10}}} the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. So Joseph brought them near to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {11}}} Israel said to Joseph, {@Char quotedblleft}I had not thought to see your face; and now God has let me see your offspring as well.{@Char quotedblright}
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {12}}} Joseph took them from his father's lap, and bowed  with his face to the earth.
 

@PP
So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {13}}} Joseph took them both -- Ephraim with his right hand toward Israel's left hand and Manasseh with his left hand toward Israel's right hand -- and brought them near to him.
 Israel {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {14}}} stretched out his right hand and laid it upon the head of Ephraim who was the younger and his left hand upon the head of Manasseh, crossing his hands intentionally, for Manasseh was the eldest.
 

@PP
He {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {15}}} then blessed Joseph, saying, {@Char quotedblleft}The God whom my forefathers Abraham and Isaac revered and served, the God who has been my shepherd all my life long unto this day,
 the {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {16}}} messenger who has delivered me from all evil, bless the boys; and let them be known as descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and let them grow into a multitude on the earth.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {17}}} when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him, and he seized his father's hand to remove it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {18}}} Joseph said to his father, {@Char quotedblleft}Not so, my father; this one is the eldest; put your right hand upon his head.{@Char quotedblright}
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {19}}} his father refused and said, {@Char quotedblleft}I know, my son, I know, he also will become a people, and he will shall be great, but his younger brother will be greater than he, and his descendants shall become a populous nation.{@Char quotedblright}
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {20}}} he blessed them that day and said, {@Char quotedblleft}The Israelites will invoke a blessing like your own, saying, {@Char quoteleft}God make you like Ephraim and like Manasseh.{@Char quoteright}{@Char quotedblright} So he put Ephraim before Manasseh.
 

@PP
And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {21}}} Jacob said to Joseph, {@Char quotedblleft}See, I am about to die; but God will be with you, and bring you back to the land of your fathers.
 As {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {22}}} well I give you a mountain-slope which I took out of the power of the Amorites with my sword and bow.{@Char quotedblright}

These {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {28}}} are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said to them and blessed them; each according
 to his blessing he blessed them. And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {29}}} he instructed them, {@Char quotedblleft}I am to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,
 in {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {30}}} the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite for the purpose of holding it as a burying-place.
 There {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {31}}} they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.
 The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {32}}} field and the cave that is in it which was purchased from the children of Heth.{@Char quotedblright}
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {33}}} when Jacob had finished giving these instructions to his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, breathed his last and was gathered to his ancestors.
 

@PP
And {@OuterNote { 10.5p @Font {@B 50}}} Joseph fell upon his father's face and wept over him and kissed him.
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {2}}} Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Jacob;
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {3}}} forty days were devoted to it, for this is the full period for embalming.
 The {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {4}}} Egyptians also mourned for him seventy days.
 

@PP
When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {5}}} the days of mourning for him were past, Joseph spoke to the members of Pharaoh's court, saying, {@Char quotedblleft}If now you wish to do me a favor, speak to Pharaoh and say, Joseph's father made him take an oath, saying, {@Char quoteleft}See, I am dying; bury me in my grave which I prepared for myself in the land of Canaan.{@Char quoteright} Ask Pharaoh, {@Char quoteleft}Let me go up, I beg of you, and bury my father; after that I will return.{@Char quoteright}{@Char quotedblright}
 Pharaoh {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {6}}} said, {@Char quotedblleft}Go up and bury your father, as he made you take an oath.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {7}}} Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went all the officials of Pharaoh, the elders of his household, all the elders of the land of Egypt,
 all {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {8}}} the household of Joseph, his brothers, and his father's household. Only their little ones, their sheep, and their cattle they left in the land of Goshen.
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {9}}} there went up with him both chariots and horsemen, so that it was a very great company.
 

@PP
When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {10}}} they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, they held there a great and impressive lamentation; and Joseph appointed a period of mourning for his father which lasted seven days.
 When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {11}}} the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, {@Char quotedblleft}This is an impressive mourning among the Egyptians.{@Char quotedblright} That is why that place across the Jordan is called, Ebel-Mizraim.
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {12}}} Jacob's sons did for him what he had commanded them:
 they {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {13}}} carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave in the field of Machpelah near Mamre which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite to hold as a place of burial.
 After {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {14}}} he had buried his father, Joseph and his brothers and all who had gone up with him to bury his father returned to Egypt.
 

@PP
When {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {15}}} Joseph's brothers realized that their father was dead, they said, {@Char quotedblleft}It may be that Joseph will now hate us and fully punish us for all the evil which we did to him!{@Char quotedblright}
 And {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {16}}} they sent this message to him: {@Char quotedblleft}Your father commanded before he died,
 {@Char quoteleft}Tell {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {17}}} Joseph: Forgive, I beg of you, the wrongdoing and sin of your brothers, for they treated you basely.{@Char quoteright} So now we beg of you forgive the wrongdoing of the servants of your father's God.{@Char quotedblright}
 

@PP
While they were speaking to him, Joseph began to weep, his {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {18}}} brothers also went and fell down before him and said, {@Char quotedblleft}See, we are your slaves.{@Char quotedblright}
 But {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {19}}} Joseph said to them, {@Char quotedblleft}Do not be afraid; for am I in the place of God?
 You {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {20}}} plotted mischief against me, but God intended it for good, in order to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of the lives of many people.
 Now {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {21}}} therefore do not be afraid; I will provide for you and your little ones.{@Char quotedblright} He said this kindly, comforting them..
 

@PP
Joseph {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {22}}} remained in Egypt with his father's family. He lived a hundred and ten years,
 and {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {23}}} he saw Ephraim's great-grandchildren; the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were borne upon Joseph's knees.
 

@PP
Then {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {24}}} Joseph said to his brothers, {@Char quotedblleft}I am about to die, but God will surely remember you and bring you up from this land to the land which he promised by an oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.{@Char quotedblright}
 Joseph {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {25}}} required an oath of the children of Israel, saying, {@Char quotedblleft}When God remembers you, as he surely will, then you must carry up my bones from here.{@Char quotedblright}
 So {@OuterNote { 8p @Font {26}}} Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old; and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
